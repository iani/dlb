From the online publication at: https://www.neme.org/texts/revisiting-inarticulacy  

** Introduction: Music, Inarticulacy and Silence

 It has been said all too often that our culture is a culture of the image, favouring the sense of vision at the detriment of other senses. As Christoph Cox points out, “prevailing theoretical models are inadequate to [sound art]. Developed to account for the textual and the visual, they fail to capture the nature of the sonic.“1. Cox argues that the resistance of sound based arts to analysis on the basis of representation and textuality has been noted early on, and has given rise to interpretations of music as either “sub-representational” (addressing raw emotion) or “super-representational” (addressing the universal and absolute). This conceptual split seems to be coupled to a sociological and anthropological one. The realm of sound attains both a privileged status and a banished one. Music plays a central role both in sacred rituals and in socially proscribed practices. This ambivalent status is reflected in the treatment of musicians and dancers in many traditions, a combination of reverence and anathema. One of the central ancient myths expressing this ambivalence is that of Orpheus, a favorite myth in western culture, from Claudio Monteverdi’s Opera in 1607 to Jean Cocteau’s film Orpheus in 1950. Between and beyond these two examples lie numerous others, such as the reconstructed references to Orpheus and Virgil in the Brandenburg Concertos of Johann Sebastian Bach2, Gluck’s popular Orfeo ed Euridice (1872), Beethoven’s commissioned portrait as Orpheus (painted by his friend Joseph Willibrord Mähler) and his programmatic references to Orpheus in the fourth Piano Concerto (1807), Jacques Offenbach’s satirical opera “Orphée aux enfers” (1858) and Jan Kott’s critical analysis of Orpheus as the prototype of the musician, artist and actor in “The Eating of the Gods“3. The Devadasi in India, the Geisha, but also the Sarugaku and Kabuki actors in Japan, are well-known examples of castes that are both shunned and revered, while the Gypsies and Roma are marginalized groups whose role as bearers of musical craftsmanship is recognized throughout modern history. These are prominent examples of the subaltern4 in the context of music. In present essay I reflect on an installation about “Narcissus and Echo” presented at the Through the Roadblocks project, as a result of a collaboration between Jean-Pierre Hébert and myself. The installation was inspired by Ovid’s version of the Narcissus myth and evoked an absent Echo through the sounds of swallows circling a delicate structure representing Narcissus. Occasionally, the installation would be silent. Over time this experience has given rise to further thoughts about silence, which are expounded in the present essay.

 The connection of music to the subaltern is rooted in a deeper affinity between the mode of existence of marginalized social groups and music as a manifestation of the non-representational aspects of consciousness. Martin Vogel has made a rare attempt to uncover hidden links between music and the animal element in the beginnings of western culture through linguistic, archaeological and anthropological studies. His thesis is summarized in the epilogue of “Onos Lyras” (“The Donkey with the Lyre”)5: In contrast to Nietzsche’s “The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music“6, Vogel proposes to show “The Birth of Music from the Spirit of the Domestication of the Donkey”. In pursuing his controversial thesis, Vogel exposes numerous links between musical practices in Africa, the Near East and Europe and banished tribes or castes that follow ancient practices of animal domestication. In a series of books, one of which is entirely dedicated to the etymology of European words related to the origins music7, Vogel uncovers hidden traces in the sound of words and in social practices and myths, linking music to the animal element. These are symbolic hints to substrata that remain from the birth of ancient civilizations and of technologies based on the domestication of animals. One of the threads in Vogel’s investigation regards the connection of words used in chant and music, such as Halleluiah, and the mating calls of donkeys. In the world of pre-modern cultures, the essential characteristic separating animal cries from speech is their inarticulacy. Animal cries represent the instinctive, non-thinking part of animal being in contrast to the logical aspect represented by speech. At about the same time as Vogel, Jacques Attali looked at the unstructured, illogical parts of music from the point of view of its means of production and of power struggles: In his book “Bruits” (“Noise”)8 he took a different sociological approach to the phenomenon of music and representation, linking attitudes towards musical form and function to technological means of production and social hierarchies of power.

 The title of Attali’s book, “Noise” is indicative of the turn of attention away from the structured to the in-articulate aspects of music in the 20th century. The switch of focus from concepts such as articulation, formal unity, relations of whole and parts, proportion and structure to the contrary concepts of noise, chaos, flow and the inarticulate in the 20th century, reflects a rising preoccupation with those levels of culture and consciousness that lie beyond the reach of logic. Cage9 writes that “music is continuous only listening is intermittent”, while Deleuze10 writes that “One can […] conceive of a continuous acoustic flow […] that traverses the world and that even encompasses silence […] A musician is someone who appropriates something from this flow” (p. 78). The recognition of the chaotic and unformed as a substratum of music contrasts with the older focus on logic, articulation and structure as the axiomatic and indisputable foundations of musical art. While recognizing the link of music to affect, the theoretical tradition of western music had cultivated an approach emphasizing the structured and articulate. Since the late Renaissance, music has been based on rhetoric as the art of persuasion, of expression and of the communication of ideas. The development of polyphonic and harmonic musical genres that led to the Classical Style of the 18th century is founded on highly formalized rules for the construction of musical form in a manner analogous to rhetorical argument11. This goes hand-in-hand with Rationalism and its bias towards clear structure and order. Thus, the failure of modern theory to disengage from the representational, and its preoccupation with the textual approach has deep historical roots. As Kim-Cohen puts it: “If there is such a strata of experience, we must accept it mutely. It finds no voice in thought or discourse. Since there is nothing we can do with it, it seems wise to put it aside and concern ourselves with that of which we can speak“12. In this context, Cox calls for “a different sort of theoretical analysis – not a theory particular to sound, but one capable of accounting for sound and the other arts.“13. An undertaking at that level requires some fundamental methodological considerations. As a step in this direction, the present essay considers an element of the sonic universe that is perhaps least analysed in relation to its importance: Silence, the absence of sound. Silence relates to the topic of inarticulacy in several ways: It is unstructured itself, yet it is the most absolute and clear structural element. It may be regarded as the quintessence of music as an art of the ineffable; for it is empty of content and by virtue of this it can adopt or be charged with any content. By consequence, the spectrum of semiotic uses of silence in music is remarkably rich, arguably richer than that of any other element. Yet while there exist morphologies of melody, harmony, rhythm and timbre, no morphology of silence has ever been proposed. One might say that attempting such a morphology would be contrary to the essence of silence as an object of study. Because of its protean nature, silence resists categorization. How might one then approach the topic of silence within the scope of a theory that starts with sound but embraces other arts, as Cox has posited? The objective of the present essay is to indicate some of the roles which silence can play in the formulation of such a trans-disciplinary theory.

** Silence and Repetition: Echo and Identity

 In “Dracula’s Legacy“14, Kittler uncovers the relationship of the mechanical recording of sound and speech to the role of women in psychoanalysis. As Josh Epstein notes, “Kittler seems to be approaching the issue of the different ways in which we as subjects receive sound as emanations from the individual signifier, and not as signified objects of “sound.“15 Since mechanical reproduction is what enables the separation of sound as an object from its source, and sound is a prime conveyor of the signified, it is a natural (but brilliant!) idea of Kittler to investigate the impact that this separation has on the relationship between the sender and receiver of the sound as carrier of a communication act. Kittler argues that mechanical reproduction caused the split of the communication process of psychoanalytical discourse into two separate feedback loops: one feminine and one mechanical16. He points out the parallels between that and another recording activity in which women played a key role: The recording of proceedings on a typewriter. As exemplary subject in this scenario, he analyses the role of Mina in Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” as the typist whose records create the main cohesive narrative in the novel. On the transition from the animalistic “Id” to the rational Ego, Kittler remarks: “In order to replace the Id with an Ego, to replace violence with technology, it is necessary that one first fall into the clutches of this violence. The beginning of every romance reverses for a certain period of time the roles of hunter and hunted.“17. Geert Lovink18 remarks that in this essay Kittler develops for the first time his thesis of “the woman (Mina Harker) who controls the registration apparatus (in this case, the newly invented typewriter) as medium of the man”. In his later works, Kittler turned increasingly to antiquity, and this is where a story about the separation of the voice from the speaker can be found, one that involves the concepts of the hunter and hunted, in reversed roles than those of Dracula. It is the story of ‘Narcissus and Echo’ as told by Ovid. The starting point for the parallel is straightforward: Like Mina, Echo has no voice of her own, but repeats the sayings of her male interlocutor. However, there are multiple reversals, and some telling differences. Here the hunter is identified with a female supernatural being who repeats the sound: Echo. Contrary to Mina, Echo is the hunter and the supernatural being at once (Note that Narcissus is out hunting deer when he is first spotted by Echo.) The alternate source repeating the sound is not a technical medium but a (super-) natural phenomenon. Underneath this lay manifestations of silence: The silence of Echo that never voices words of her own. The silence into which the words of the caller are echoed. And finally, the silence separating individual repetitions of an echo. Here is silence revealed in its purest incarnation, as an articulating inarticulate element. The primal musical counterpart of Echo is antiphony (a call and response type of singing), a ubiquitous, primeval musical form. Deleuze made this form a central subject of his thought through is writings on “refrain”, in conjunction with further central notions: repetition and difference. One may say that silence is revealed as that which makes repetition possible. Furthermore, the myth of Narcissus and Echo exposes silence as a vital if inaudible element of dialogue. The refrain is a special variant of antiphony, which separates the roles of the partners in a dialogue: One partner spins the tale forward, while the other provides a stable ground through repetition. In the refrain, the repetition becomes decoupled from the forward-moving, changing discourse of the narrating actor, in order to provide a stable ground or orientation point that provides the setting for the narration. Here we already have terms that start from sound to encompass other realms of expression: “Ground” or “ground bass” denotes a repeating theme that is steadily repeated (Italian: Ostinato), forming the basis for a piece through variations. In discourse, the Ground is the Echo, the partner that reflects the tale spun by the active narrator. The term ground expresses the foundational, stability-lending role of this element. The term ground also links to the idea of background in the visual arts.

**  Silence, Rupture and Distance

 Silence started being used as an expressive device in music at the point of transition between the Renaissance and Mannerism and the Baroque period. Notable examples are found in works by Gesualdo da Venosa, and in the Italian Madrigals of Heinrich Schütz (1610) and Claudio Monteverdi. The importance of silence is acknowledged in Baroque musical rhetorical theory through a group of figures used to express either silence or a break in the composition: Apokope (an omitted or shortened final note in one voice), aposiopesis (a rest in one or all voices), abruptio or ellipsis (the sudden breaking off of musical passage), homoioptoton, homoioteleuton, tmesis, suspiratio, and pausa. Abruptio is used to express loss, downfall, or destruction19. Johann Sebastian Bach’s work contains an extraordinary example of abruptio combined with aposiopesis, a rare instance of a piece ending with an incomplete melody fragment followed by notated silence. It occurs in “Actus Tragicus” (“Tragic Act”, BWV 106), a funeral cantata that Bach composed when he was barely 23 years of age. The silence is situated at the pivotal point of the piece, separating the first part representing the Old Testament view of death from the second part representing the New Testament’s view. This is one of the most striking expressions of rupture in the musical repertoire. It is introduced by a dense, sombre and dissonant passage embedded in an antithetical setting: Low strings and voices illustrate the words “human, you must die” while a single high female voice contrasts this, chanting “Yes come, Lord Jesus”. The parts of the low layer break off one after the other, leaving the high voice soaring alone, until it also fades away (pianissimo) with a phrase suspended in mid air. There follows a bar of silence. This setting connects silence to death, to rupture and to the expectation of transition. Here, silence forms part of a group of signs that signify rupture and death: The contrast between high and low register, downward melodic leaps, and finally, what one might call the “broken” or “crossed” tetrachord. This is a sequence of four scale steps (g a b c), which is broken in the middle by a downward leap to the lower octave between a and b. The motif figures prominently in the beginning of the above movement, as theme of a fugato to the words “It is the old testament”. Here emptiness is expressed by the distance between a and b, heard as a break in the stepwise movement of g a b c. This motif is found in many other works, spanning Bach’s entire output (e.g. “Motet Komm Jesu Komm” BWV229, the theme of the g minor Fugue from the Well Tempered Clavier, WTK 861, the middle movement of Brandenburg Concerto No 6 BWV 1051, divided between two oboes in the the opening of St John Passion, BWV 245). It also figures prominently in major works of the classical repertory such as in the last movement of Mozart’s 40th Symphony, the Scherzo of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony and the last movement of his 3rd Piano Concerto.

** Silence, Spans, Erasure, Stasis

 In “Music Discomposed” Stanley Cavell gives the following example of a question that a critic might ask about a work of art: “Why does Beethoven put in a bar of rest in the last line of the fourth Bagatelle (Op. 126)?“20 Of all possible questions about Beethoven’s work, this is one of the most perplexing ones: The pause appears quasi out of nowhere, with nothing to suggest its place in the flow of the piece. The context of the Bagatelles as playful explorations of formal possibilities suggests that this piece is an experiment with pauses. Two previous pauses in the same piece confirm this. These pauses are reminiscent of Haydn’s experiments with pauses, as for example in the String Quartet op 33 No 2 (“Joke Quartet”). While Haydn’s style is still close to baroque rhetoric, it extends beyond that: His pauses, embedded in the symmetric structure of periods of the classical style, trick the listener into trying to complete mentally that which appears to have been missed or discontinued. Haydn’s pauses are not just semantic complements in the rhetoric of the piece, they challenge the structure of the narrative itself. They create a puzzle: Why is the performance suddenly interrupted between phrases? Here silence is a device that points to the performance of the piece itself as an object consisting of sound and action. In other words, Haydn’s pauses are no longer just signs in a musical score. They point at the sound as object in itself and not merely a manifestation of the written text. Heightening the effect of this device, the quartet ends in a silence following the initial short phrase of the last movement, thus negating the structural sense of an end by a beginning, and creating both a closed circle and an open structure that continues into “empty” time. In Beethoven’s Bagatelle, the silence is inserted at the end of a transition, as if obliterating the passage that modulates to the next section. It is as if the text has been deliberately erased from the score, leaving emptiness where there surely must be something. Haydn’s and Beethoven’s pieces are like precursors of Lothar Wolleh’s portrait of René Magritte, with a photo of the artist outside the frame, and the head missing under the hat in the picture itself.

 Silence can also hide behind a curtain of sound. Such is the case in the opening of Chopin’s Scherzo No 4, Op. 54. This silence behind a single chord held for the entire second part of a period is the subject of analysis in Hasty’s contribution to a Deleuzian theory in music21. This held pause at once suspends the movement of the piece and creates a sense of aporia (“Where is this going, and why are we suspended in air?…”) This is answered in the second appearance of the opening theme in the middle of the piece, where the (previously removed or hidden) chords are inserted underneath the held chord. The above pieces of Beethoven and Chopin can be seen as precursors of sound 
montage, where parts of the sound are removed or added as objects. Silence thus is a prerequisite for the conception of the sonic object, Pierre Schaeffer’s “Objet Sonore“22.
 
** Conclusion

 Silence is the element of music that allows the greatest disruptive and semiotic power at the same time. The unfolding of its different aspects has been a gradual process throughout the history of Western music. The break created by silence opens views to otherwise hidden aspect of cultural semiosis. It also acts as a tool to effect a change of view, perspective or level. Discontinuity, inarticulacy and emptiness are revealed to be potent motors for imagination, creativity, and dialogue. In the program outlined by Cox, that of a theory of sound that encompasses also other arts, silence is the bridge between inarticulacy and the articulate. By virtue of this, it opens gateways to the exploration of pervading human experiences which are otherwise difficult to externalize, such as the sense of absence, separation and distance.

 "Can the Subaltern Be Heard?": Political Theory, Translation, Representation, and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak

Abstract

Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's essay "Can the Subaltern Speak?" questions the notion of the colonial (and Western) "subject" and provides an example of the limits of the ability of Western discourse, even postcolonial discourse, to interact with disparate cultures. This article suggests that these limits can be (partially) overcome. Where much commentary on Spivak focuses on her reading of Marx through the prism of Derrida, and on her contention that the "native informant" is simultaneously created and destroyed, I contends that Spivak's terms of engagement always imply a liberal-independent subject that is actively speaking. Moreover, given the limits of understanding implied by Spivak's essay, I advocate a reading of culture (s) based on the assumption that all actions offer a communicative role, and that one can understand cultures by translating the various conducts of their culture. On this basis I argue that the title of Spivak's essay might be more accurately stated as "Can the Subaltern Be Heard?"

* Pros and cons of Studying in Berkeley
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DATE:     <2021-04-04 Sun 23:58>
  :END:

** Pros of Berkeley:

- the opportunity to take classes with world-class scholars and scientists.
- the opportunity to get involved in research. These experiences can be essential to getting into competitive PhD programs. When you get to campus, ask faculty whose work you admire whether they give research opportunities to undergrads, and how to prepare for work in their labs. They may tell you they require students to take specific courses, or to have specific skills. Then ask other students for recommendations about which labs to join and what their experiences are. In general, you may need to spend two years in a lab to have your name on a paper by the time you apply for graduate school, so you’ll want to start thinking about what labs you might join, and what faculty you might work with, during your freshman year.
- a truly multi-cultural scene, both because of the people on campus (students, faculty and post-doctoral scholars) and because of the local environment (i.e., cafes, restaurants and music in and around the city of Berkeley).
- the beauty of the natural environment: the beaches and redwood forests of Marin county, the wine country of the Napa and Sonoma valleys, the beaches of Santa Cruz, Carmel and Big Sur, the mountains and skiing at Lake Tahoe and the Sierras; all are easy day trips (by car) from Berkeley.

** Cons:

- Crime in and around campus. If you decide to attend Berkeley, you’ll need to develop street smarts. Avoid the area around People’s Park (in general) and be careful after dark.
- Stress. Berkeley is a very competitive school. Students who were at the tops of their classes in high school can find that they struggle at Berkeley. The solution to this is to get involved in study groups, attend faculty office hours, and don’t procrastinate. Ask questions in class if you don’t understand a question. Do all the reading before the lecture during which that material will be discussed. Take care of your body: eat well, get enough sleep, get exercise. Have a good social life — good friends and get out and about — but keep partying to a minimum during the semesters. If this isn’t the kind of life you want, then go to another school.
- Not all courses listed in the catalog are offered every semester, and many classes are hard to get into (especially for students in other majors).
- You have to declare a major early, and the major you choose can have a big impact on your experience. For instance, if you want to have real computational skills, whether for work in industry or graduate school, you will be better off majoring in computer science or EECS, because of course restrictions.

** The bottom line:

- All UC campuses have great faculty and provide opportunities for research for motivated students. The biggest UC campuses (Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego) have more opportunities for research with top scholars and scientists, but the smaller UC campuses can be more comfortable for many students, with a more supportive environment and less stress.
- Consider what lifestyle you want, and the environment in which you can flourish, not just as a student but as a human being. If you’re really driven and want to become a professor, then going to a top-tier university may be important for your career. If that’s not as important to you as enjoying your life, then consider one of the smaller campuses. While Berkeley is great in basically every field, the other campuses (and smaller universities in general) can provide an outstanding environment to prepare students for work in industry or for graduate school.
- If you decide to go to Berkeley, then take it seriously, and give it the focus it requires to do well. Acquire solid time management skills and street smarts. Choose your major wisely.

 Lastly, let me encourage you to find a field that you love, wherever you go to school. Good luck!

* Socrates on Writing as the Enemy of Memory

Lapham’s Quarterly

c. 370 BC | Athens

Unintended Consequence

Writing as the enemy of memory.

Socrates: Among the ancient gods of Naucratis in Egypt there was one to whom the bird called the ibis is sacred. The name of that divinity was Thoth, and it was he who first discovered number and calculation, geometry and astronomy, as well as the games of checkers and dice, and above all else, writing.

Contributor
Plato

From “Phaedrus.” Socrates did not write any of his teachings down; what we know of his beliefs are mostly contained in the extensive works of Plato. The latter wrote in his “Letter VII,” however, that there is some knowledge which cannot be recorded but rather, “After long-continued intercourse between teacher and pupil, in joint pursuit of the subject, suddenly, like light flashing forth when a fire is kindled, it is born in the soul and straightway nourishes itself.” 

Now, the king of all Egypt at that time was Thamus, who lived in the great city in the upper region that the Greeks call Egyptian Thebes; Thamus they call Amun. Thoth came to exhibit his arts to him and urged him to disseminate them to all the Egyptians. Thamus asked him about the usefulness of each art, and while Thoth was explaining it, Thamus praised him for whatever he thought was right in his explanations and criticized him for whatever he thought was wrong.

The story goes that Thamus said much to Thoth, both for and against each art, which it would take too long to repeat. But when they came to writing, Thoth said, “O king, here is something that, once learned, will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memory; I have discovered a potion for memory and for wisdom.” Thamus, however, replied, “O most expert Thoth, one man can give birth to the elements of an art, but only another can judge how they can benefit or harm those who will use them. And now, since you are the father of writing, your affection for it has made you describe its effects as the opposite of what they really are. In fact, it will introduce forgetfulness into the soul of those who learn it: they will not practice using their memory because they will put their trust in writing, which is external and depends on signs that belong to others, instead of trying to remember from the inside, completely on their own. You have not discovered a potion for remembering, but for reminding; you provide your students with the appearance of wisdom, not with its reality. Your invention will enable them to hear many things without being properly taught, and they will imagine that they have come to know much while for the most part they will know nothing. And they will be difficult to get along with, since they will merely appear to be wise instead of really being so.”

    Gilgamesh

    When reading any text, but especially an ancient one, you should always memorize five (and a half) things. I am likely to ask you about the five (and a half) things in the short answer section on quizzes and even exams, so keep them in mind as you study the content as well! • Author • Title • Date • Location • Language (5 ½ history of the text)

    Author: Traditional epic; orally transmitted and eventually collected, edited and circulated by Sîn-liqe-unninniof Uruk • You’ll notice that with many ancient texts it’s not possible to be assured of one single author. This is especially true of texts that have a history of oral tradition.

    Title: He who saw the deep, Epic of Gilgamesh • “He who saw the deep” is the 1st line of the “standard” version of the epic, how many ancient works were known (especially poetry). There are many Gilgamesh stories; the one we are reading is rather extended and holds together as one piece; hence it is known today as “The Epic of Gilgamesh”

    Date: • Earliest Sumerian / Akkadian versions, • oral and written: 2150-1900bc; • other written text: 1700bc (frag.); • He who saw the deep: 1300-1000bc • “Versions” of the Gilgamesh myth are recorded from the end of the 3rd millennium bc, but the earliest evidence for the complete (*) written text is the end of the 2nd millennium bc.

    Location: • Mesopotamia • The Gilgamesh epic deals with peoples and places from what was Sumer and Akkad; while the history of these specific peoples and places is important to keep in mind, the general feel we will get from reading this in the context of this course is the general location of “Mesopotamia”

    Language: • Babylonian (an Akkadian literary dialect) • You will notice several renderings throughout your text of the cuneiform script which was carved into clay tablets which preserve the epic as we know it today (such as are preserved from etchings and photographs).

    [textual tradition/edition]: • pp. xvi-xxx in your text; • this edition, p. xv-xvi in your text • Understand we are reading a translation of a late period of the text's tradition, witnessed by 73 mss (clay tablets in this case), but supplemented in its lacunae by earlier witnesses to the text (as early as almost a millenium before the standard edition), and of course with an oral tradition component prior to writing and throughout the tradition.

    [textual tradition/edition]: • pp. xvi-xxx in your text; • this edition, p. xv-xvi in your text • Imagine a king who lived in 2700bc, they kept handing down the legend of his story in oral form, and then various poems continued to be sung & written down & recopied, etc., for hundreds of years. • Then in the 12th c sometime, a more-or-less standard series of tablets recorded the vital portions. A mix of oral and scribal tradition, codified in late bronze / early iron age. • Recopied at height of Assyrian empire (800bc) but supplemented by almost 2000 years of prior written witness. • Also, read pp. 209-221 to understand textual criticism

    Gilgamesh • Major literary concerns: • Epic poetry • Formal structure (parallelism) • Fragmentation and textual tradition • Comparative traditions (Noah and Utnapishtim) • Talking about mythology and history

    Gilgamesh • Themes: • Mortality vs immortality • Civilization vs barbarism • Human development • Friendship • Responsibility of the king

#+begin_quote
Although Dürr dates this cantata as far back as 1724 and Whittaker; following Terry, gives the date as late as 1745, when Frederick the Great’s second invasion of Saxony occurred, the libretto does stress the scourge of war as well as the time of plague in 1584, when Martin Moller wrote the hymn.

The unknown librettist – Schweitzer names Picander – arranged stanzas 1, 3 & 5 in their original form and paraphrased the other stanzas, which Bach se as arias. All verses of the poem reflect upon the sadness by war and plague. Bach illustrates their theme of lamentation with deep emotional appeal. The Gospel for the event ids Luke 19: 41-48. The libretto reflects verses 41-44 – Christ’s prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem. This Scripture would have great significance for Bach and has the congregation so soon after the latest war, because Leipzig was the modern Jerusalem in their opinion. Did Bach imagine that the ‘real’ Jerusalem has rarely been ‘in peace and quiet’ (Mvt. 3) along its long history up to our time?

MATHEMATICS IN CARNATIC MUSIC

 

      Music is an extremely subjective experience.  Some of the sound waves that reach the human ear are perceived to be pleasant while others are unpleasant and merely termed as noise.  Thus, music is the art of combining sounds with a view to beauty of expression of emotion.  Musically good melodies are thus harmonious in character.

    Mathematics is the basis of sound wave propagation, and a pleasant sound consists of harmony arising out of musical scales in terms of numerical ratios, particularly those of small integers.   Mathematics is music for the mind while music is mathematics for the soul. 

    A suitable permutation and combination of some basic notes gives rise to melodious music which enthrals and transports one to a new enjoyable experience.  While theoretically infinite possibilities can be thought of, only 279 had been in vogue. In Carnatic music, seven notes or swaras as they are called, form the foundation of the various permutations and combinations. Theoretically, one can mathematically think of 7! = 5040 possibilities.  But only 72 of them, called Janaka ragas, have been analyzed and found to have practical usage from the melody point of view.  A raga thus has a set of rules that specify what notes of the octave must be used under the given rule and how  to move from one note to the other. A Melkartha raga must necessarily have Sa and Pa and one of the Mas, one each of the Ris and Ga's, and one each of the Dhas and Nis, and further Ri must precede Ga and Dha must precde Ni, and thus we have 2 x 6 x 6 =72 possibilities of the Melakartha ragas.

    It was Venkata Makhi who first thought of classifying these 72 ragams or combinations of swaras, and later Govindacharya adopted a slightly different combination.  The basic swaras in Carnatic music and those that correspond to the basic notes in Western music are as follows:

                         Western system:   C    D   E   F   G   A   B

                         Carnatic music:    Sa  Ri  Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni

In the equal tempered system of Western music, the successive notes have a ratio of twelfth root of 2 as shown below:

                            Note                  Ratio

                              C                       1

                  Minor second C    1.059463

                  Major second C    1.122462

                  Minor third           1.189207

                  Major third           1.259921

                  Perfect fourth       1.334840

                Augmented fourth  1.414214

                  Perfect fifth          1.498307

                  Minor sixth           1.587401

                  Major sixth           1.681793

                  Minor seventh      1.781797

                  Major seventh      1.887749

In the Carnatic music system also, just as in the Western music system, some of the swaras have small variants, and according to some scholars, 22 such notes are possible with the ratios as given below to the fundamental Sa.

                   Swara              Ratio           Frequency I Hz

                      Sa                    1                     240

                      Ga3              5/4                       300

                      Ga4             81/64                    303.7

                      Ma1              4/3                      320

                      Ma3             45/32                   337.5

                      Ma4             64/45                   341.3

                      Dha2               8/5                   384

                      Dha3               5/3                   400

                      Dha4              27/16                405

                      Ni1               16/9                   426.6

                      Ni2                9/5                    432

                      Ni3               115/8                 450

                      Ni4                31/16                465

But according to some scholars, Ma has only 2 variants while Ri, Ga, Dha and Ni have only 3 variants each while Sa and Pa are fixed, and Venkata Makhi has followed this system in his classification of the ragas in vogue.  Although many ragas might have been in existence earlier, it was first Venkata Makhi who made a classification of the ragas by allotting them a number in what is called the Melakartha system, by adding prefix to the existing ones wherever necessary, following the katapayaaadi system of numbering; he considered a raga to be a Melakartha raga only if all the 7 swaras were present in the regular order in the ascending as well as descending mode.  Govindacharya, however, allowed some freedom in this respect, and permitted deviation of the order as well as absence of any particular swara in either mode provided all the 7 swaras were present.

      Melakartha ragas have a swara pattern, with arohanam and avarohanam, the latter being the mirror image of the former, and both together make a musical palindrome!
     The 72 Melakartha ragas, according to Venkata Makhi, consisting of all the 7 swaras in the ascending as well as descending mode in proper order, are called Janaka ragas or parent ragas, and other ragas which arose out of them with absence of one or more of the 7 swaras were called Janya ragas (offspring ragas).  The Janya ragas are derived from the 72 fundamental set by the permutation and combination of various ascending and descending notes, and matematically about 3000 such janya ragas are possible. The 72 Melakartha raga system was responsible for the transformation  of the raga system of carnatic music.  Many new ragas came into existence and were popularised by great musical savants like Saint Thyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar etc. and many different kinds of musical compossitions were developed with different structural arrangements. The musical forms included Varnam, Kriti, Padam, Javali, Tillana, Swarangal, Swarajati etc.
     The genius of the musician consists in how he can move to intermediate frequencies between those specified by the seven basic notes, and create microtones melodious and pleasing to the ear, called gamakas.  (When one talks of the intermediate frequencies one is reminded of the Raman Effect discovered by the renowned Indian Nobel Laureate in Physics, Sir C.V.Raman.  While studying the spectra of fluids, he found that there were frequencies intermediate between those predicted according to Bohr's postulates, and he was able toexplain them as being due to intermediate energy levels arising out of further degrees of freedom of the fluid molecules giving rise to vibrational, rotational etc. spectra).
    

     (The list of the Melakartha ragas and the number of the Melakartha to which the raga belongs is decided according to the katapayaadi system of numeration as prevalent in ancient India, which is as follows:

     The following verse found in Śaṅkaravarman's Sadratnamāla explains the mechanism of the system.

 नज्ञावचश्च शून्यानि संख्या: कटपयादय:|
 मिश्रे तूपान्त्यहल् संख्या न च चिन्त्यो हलस्वर:||

nanyāvacaśca śūnyāni saṃkhyāḥ kaṭapayādayaḥ
miśre tūpāntyahal saṃkhyā na ca cintyo halasvaraḥ

Translation: na (न), nya (ञ) and a (अ)-s i.e. vowels represent zero. The (nine) integers are represented by consonant group beginning with ka, ṭa, pa, ya. In a conjunct consonant, the last of the consonants alone will count. A consonant without vowel is to be ignored.

The assignment of letters to the numerals is as per the following arrangement.

Consonants have numerals assigned as per the above table. For example, ba (ब) is always three 3 whereas 5 can be represented by either nga (ङ) or ṇa (ण) or ma (म) or śha (श).

All stand-alone vowels like a (अ) and ṛ (ऋ) are assigned to zero 0.

In case of a conjunct, consonants attached to a non-vowel will not be valueless. For example, kya (क्या) is formed by k (क्) + ya (य) + a (अ). The only consonant standing with a vowel is ya (य). So the corresponding numeral for kya (क्या) will be 1.

There is no way of representing Decimal separator in the system.

Indians used the Hindu-Arabic numeral system for numbering, traditionally written in increasing place values from left to right. This is as per the rule aṅkānām vāmato gati (अङ्कानाम् वामतो गति) which means numbers go from left to right.

     The moment the name of a raga is given, the above system is used to find the Melakartha of that raga.  Sometimes to fix the correct number, the name of the raga is slightly changed, as for instance, Sankarabharanam is called Dheerasankarabhaaranam, and Kalyani is called Mechakalyani and so on.

    Let us consider some examples.  Take Mayamalava Gowla. Here, Ma stands for 5 and ya stands for 1. So, the number we get is 51, and as per the reversing rule, the number of the Melkartha is 15.

    Then, consider Simhendra Madhyamam. Sa stands for 7, and Ma for 5.  The number is 75 and on reversing it is 57, which is the Melakartha of this raga. (The second consonant ha has number 8, and on reversal would give 87 as melakartha raga which is nonexistent. Hence, ma is taken in simha as the second consonant).

    Now, consider Vachaspati. Va stands for 4, and cha for 6, and the number is 46 which on reversing gives 64 as its Melakartha. Sa and Pa are taken as fixed for all the Melakartha ragas.

     The question arises which variant of Ri, Ga, Ma, Dha, Ni figures in what parent raga.  

     For ragas whose Melakartha number is 36 or less, M1 is chosen and for ragas whose Melakartha number is 37 or more, M2 is chosen.

    Regarding the choice of the variant of Ri, Ga, Dha and Ni, this is decided with a little bit of mathematics.  This method, which was perhaps prevalent earlier was refined to generate the entire raga by Ajay Sathyanath in April 1999 and published under the title “Mathematical Fundas in Indian Classical Music” and this gives an elegant method to determine the variants needed. (cf. http://ajaysat.tripod.com/carnatic.html )

Step 1: First, find the number of the Melakartha raga using the Katapayaadi system.  Suppose it is K.

Step 2:  Consider [[K/6]], called the ceiling function of K/6, that is, the integer which is equal to greater than K/6.  e.g. Suppose K is 31.  Then 31/6=5.1…, and [[K/6]] is 6.  If K is 30, then [[K/6]] = 5. If [[K/6]] > 6, then take mod 6 of that number arrived at.

Step 3: Now, consider K modulo 6.  Since this number will lie between 0 and 5 only, we make this lie between 1 and 6 by setting 0 as 6.  If K is 31, then 31 = 1 mod 6.  So, we consider only 1 for the procedure to be followed as outlined below.

Step 4: Consider a 3 x 4 upper triangular matrix, as shown below:

                               1          2          3

                              ….        4          5

                              ….     …..         7, and we identify these elements as:

1        = (1,1)

2        = (1.2)

3        = (1,3)

4        = (2.2)

5        = (2.3)

6        = (3,.3)

The matrix can now be written for convenience as :

                    (1,1)     (1,2)     (1,3)

                     ….       (2,2)     (2,3)

                     ….        ……    (3,3)

 

In the example considered in step 2, we have the number 6 corresponding to (3,3), we have Ra3 and Ga 3.

Step 5: In step 3, we had 1 as residue after dividing 31 by 6.  So, 1 corresponds to (1,1) as indicated above. So, the swaras chosen are Dha1 and Ni3.

31 < 36, and hence we have Ma1.

So, the raga characteristic of Melakartha raga 31 (Yagapriya) is:

           Sa  Ra3 Ga3 Ma1 Dha1 Ni1 and S  in arohana and

           Sa Ni1 Dha1 Ma1, Ga3, Ra3 and S in avarohana.

Ex.:Now, let us consider another example: consider Shubhapanthuvarali: Sha stands for 5 and bha stands for 4, so, the number is 54, which on reversal gives 45. 45 > 36, and hence we have Ma2.

To sum up, if [[K/6]] is as defined above, then in this case [[45/6]] =8 = 2 mod 6. 2 corresponds to (1,2), and hence we have Ri1 and Ga2.

  45 = 3 mod 6.   3 corresponds to (1,3) in the matrix, and so, we have Dha1 and Ni3.

To sum up:

(i)                Find the Melakartha number of the raga with the katapayaadi system. Suppose it is K.

(ii)              If K = 36 or <36, then we have Ma1. If K >37, we have Ma2.

(iii)            Consider [[K/6]] = a. If a is > 6, take mod 6 of a, suppose it is a*, then find the element in the matrix corresponding to a* which lies between 1 and 6 only. That will decide Ri and Ga.

(iv)            Now, consider K = b mod 6.  Find the element corresponding to b in the matrix, and that will decide Dha and Ni.

 A list of the Melakartha (Janaka) ragas as well as the janya ragas under them and also those not associated with them or whose scales are not yet added is given in appendix 1.

https://www.quora.com/How-many-ragas-are-there-in-carnatic-music

Hemadarshini Viswanathan
, Senior Grade Carnatic Vocal Music (2016)
Answered April 28, 2017

In principle, there can be an infinite number of ragas. This is true for any branch of music.

NOTE: My explanation may be quite long, but its worth if you want to know the roots of its working!

First, we choose a pitch (frequency) where we would like to sing. This is different for different people and instrumentalists. (Generally denoted by G D E .. and so on) In Carnatic, it is generally denoted by numbers like 5, 6 and a half (Also called “katte” in Tamil).

Now, there is a fixed range from your base pitch (called Adhara Shruthi) till a certain pitch after which the notes seem repeated(sound similar) For example, shadja (S) and thara sthayi shadja (S denoted by dot above) sound similar. In an ocatve, there are always 12 notes. This is true for all kinds of music including Carnatic, Hindustani, Western and even folk.

For a basic raaga (called Janak raaga - from which ‘n’ number of other ragas can be constructed) there should always be seven distinct notes (S R G M P D N)

Being a science student, I can roughly compare these raagas to the periodic table and they are fixed in number.

A Janaka raaga has rules:

    Always has S R G M P D N
    Template is strictly ascending and then descending
    No two notes of same pitch repeated

Many people ask how can there be different kinds of templates with the same S R G M P D N

The answer is there are 12 notes. In different branches of music, these are denoted differently. So you can have 2 different madhyama (M) (true in Carnatic) and so on. Our task is to construct different raagas with different 7 notes.

In Carnatic music, to increase the variety, these 12 notes are converted to 16. In Hindustani, the 12 notes are kept as they are. (How ? - very simple - you put 2 different swaras in the same pitch. Like a R and a G in the same pitch.)

Therefore, while constructing, we take care that a R and a G sitting in the same place are not put together in one raaga.

This is how the swaras look.

We have S and P which never change and are therefore present in all 72 raagas.

We have 3 R, 3 G , 2 M , 3 D and 3 Ns.

First 36 have M1 and next 36 have M2.

All we have to do is pick combinations of R G D and N

There are 6 ways in which you pick R and G, according to the rules. So, there are 6 chakras. Each chakra has all swaras fixed except D and N.

There are 6 ways in which you pick D and N. Which means you have 6 raagas each for each chakra.

There is a popular saying:

Ri Ga Bhedena Chakraha; Da Ni Bhedena Raagaha

(Change R G to get Chakra, change D N to get Raaga)

Therefore,2 blocks each of 32.

Each block having 6 chakras.

Each chakra having 6 raagas.

Therefore, 2 x 6 x 6 = 72.

Didn’t I say there are infinite number of raagas? Here are just 72.

Now, we can “derive” as many raagas from each of these! (Called janya raaga) People who know object programming can roughly compare them to class and subclasses inherited from the main classes.

Let’s take raaga number 29 - Shankarabharana.

You remove M and D from it, you get Hamsadwani - S R G P N

You remove G and and N from it, you get Shudhdha Saveri - S R M P D

Now, you remove G and N only from ascending template. You get Aarabhi

S R M P D —— N D P M G R S

Not only this, the above mentioned raagas are “purely” derived only from their Janaka raagas. Sometimes, a derived raaga can “borrow” swaras from other raagas (Computer people - like a foreign key in a database) callled a foreign swara.

Ex: Kaapi, Saaranga, Bilahari and so on..

So you understand that there can be variety of raagas, depending on the number of notes, raaga derived from, foreign notes and so on.

Basically, you can take as many swaras from the original 12 and make a raaga.

None of the main 72 ragas have 2 notes of the same swaras (like 2 G’s) (not allowed)

But you are free to construct janya raagas like that.

Ex : Hameer Kalyani has both M’s , derived from Kalyani and has foreign swara M1

Not done yet!

You can change the position of the swaras to get new raagas.

Ex: Vasantha , a very popular raaga derived from Suryakanta(17)

S M G M D N

S N D M G R

You see, in the ascending scale, there is a zig-zag of swaras.

Now, you know why there are infinite number of raagas.

You can also discover (or construct) a raaga by analysing a lot more (relationship, shruthi’s and so on) of the notes you have chosen and compose in it.

The very popular raaga Hamsasdhwani which is sung at the beginning of most concerts today was discovered by Ramaswamy Dikshitar, father of the celebrated composer Muthuswamy Dikshitar.

****** The meaning of ⏓

⏓ notates an *anceps*, i.e. can be a short or a long syllable.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anceps : 

#+begin_quote
In languages with quantitative poetic metres, such as Ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic, Sanskrit, and classical Persian, an anceps (plural ancipitia[1] or (syllabae) ancipites[2]) is a position in a metrical pattern which can be filled by either a long or a short syllable.

In general, anceps syllables in words, such as the first syllable of the Greek words Ἄρης Árēs (the Greek god of war) or πικρός pikrós "bitter", which can be treated by poets as either long or short, can be distinguished from anceps elements or positions in a metrical pattern, which are positions where either a long syllable or a short syllable can be used.[3]

****** Eight Akshara kala talams of the South Indian Tala system
       :PROPERTIES:
       :DATE:     <2021-05-08 Sat 04:07>
       :END:

https://kalyanikalamandir.com/blogs/eight-akshara-kala-talams-of-the-south-indian-tala-system/

#+begin_quote
Kalyani Kala Mandir

The South Indian Talam System has primarily Seven Talams. These are as follows:

    Ada Talam
    Dhruva Talam
    Eka Talam
    Jumpa Talam
    Matya Talam
    Rupaka Talam
    Triputa

All of these talams consist of different parts or angas, which can be a few or all combinations of Laghu, Dhrutam and Anudhrutam.
The Laghu is expressed with a clap and a few beats. It can vary according to the jati of the talam. Hence, it can consist of 4 beats( chatusra jaati), 3 beats( Tisra Jaati), 7 beats( Misra Jaati), 5 beats( Khanda Jaati) or 9 beats( Sangeerna Jaati). The symbol for Laghu is 1.
The Dhrutam is expressed by a clap and a wave. It always has 2 beats. Its symbol is 0.
The Anudhrutam is expressed by a single clap. It always has 1 beat. Its symbol is U

Most of the Talams have the laghu and anudhrutams, the number of repetitions may vary.
The only talam which has an anudhrutam is the Jumpa talam. Eka Talam is the only talam which has no Dhrutam.

Based on the symbols, the 7 talams can be symbolically represented as the following:

    Ada Talam: 1100
    Dhruva Talam : 1011
    Eka Talam: 1
    Jumpa: 1U0
    Matya: 101
    Rupaka Talam:01
    Triputa talam: 100

Now, if we mathematically analyse these Talams, the ones which shall have only eight Aksharakalas or matras or beats will be the following:

1. Jumpa Talam, in Khanda jaati: Its symbol is 1U0= 5+1+2=8 beats( 1 laghu of 5 beats, 1 anudhrutam and 1 dhrutam)

In Tala lipi, it can be shown as below:

S R G S R l G l M .  ll
R G M R G l M l P . ll
G M P G M l P l D . ll
M P D M P l D l N . ll
P D N P D l N l S .  ll

2. Matya talam , Tisra Jaati: Its symbol is 101= 3+2+3=8 beats ( 1 Laghu of 3 beats, 1 dhrutam and 1 more laghu of 4 beats)

In talalipi, it can be written as below:

S R G l S R l S R G ll
R G M l R G l R G M ll
G M P l G M l G M P ll
M P D l M P l M P D ll

D N S l D N l D N S ll

3. Triputa Talam, Chatusra Jati: Its symbol is 100=4+2+2= 8 beats( 1 Laghu of 4 beats + 2 Dhrutams)

In Talalipi, it can be written as shown below:

S R S R l S R l G M ll

****** COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CARNATIC TALA SYSTEM AND HINDUSTANI TALA SYSTEM

https://kalyanikalamandir.com/comparative-analysis-of-the-carnatic-tala-system-and-hindustani-tala-system/

#+begin_quote

The Hindustani and the Carnatic Tala Systems form the backbone of Indian music and dance. They are well developed, intricate systems using different kinds of beats in various mathematical metric cycles during performances of dance, music or other musical instruments.

Although the comparison between these two systems can be quite elaborate, we have tried to give a simple, basic overview to the differences and similarities between them.

Similarities:

1. Both the Tala Systems are depicted by a number of beats in a set duration to be repeated during each piece performed.
2. The beats are marked with a system of hand claps, hand waves and the movements of the fingers.
3. The most important point of the rhythmic emphasis is the ‘sam’, the first beat of the tala, and to which all variations eventually return.
4. Both the Tala Systems use various symbols depicting the different parts or ‘angas’ of the Tala.
5. Usually, each word or beat has a rest of equal duration, but there are exceptions in both Tala systems where this rule isn’t followed.
6. The syllables or bols are used in both and used as one word, which have the same time value within the tala.
7. Both follow the depiction of Sam with a handclap.
8. Both follow three speeds.
9. They both follow a 3 cycle rhythmic end to finish a rhythmic pattern.
10. Both the systems follow the yati.

Differences:

- The Carnatic System has 7 basic Talams. These are Ada, Dhruva, Eka, Jumpa, Matya ,Rupaka and Triputa. The Hindustani system has approximately 12 widely used tals – mainly the Tintal, Jhoomra, Tilwada, Dhamar, Ektal, Jhaptal, Keherwa, Rupak, Dadra, Chowtal, Chachar and Sitarkhani.
- The Sam is depicted by the symbol + in Hindustani system, but doesn’t have a particular symbol in the Carnatic system.
- The Carnatic system has about 16 angas. The most common are the laghu, Dhrutam and anudhrutam shown by the symbols l, 0 and U. Anudhrutam has 1 aksharakala, Dhrutam has 2 aksharakalas and laghu has the possibility of upto 5 kinds of Aksharakalas ranging from 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 depending upon the jaati of the tala. ( aksharakalas meaning the number of taps used). These aksharakalas can further be divided into ‘nadais’ which determine the number of beats contained in each aksharakala. These are again of 5 types- 3, 4, 5, 7, 9- tisram, chatusram, khandam, mishram ,sangeernam.
- The Hindustani tala’s beats are known as tali and khali- Each tali is numbered beginning with 2 , 3 and so on. The first is written as +. The khali is an emphasized beat shown by the wave of the hand and written by the symbol 0. In Carnatic system, 0 is dhrutam having 2 beats marked by a clap and a wave. Hence, the angas of the two tala systems are different and have different beats and symbols assigned to them.
- The rests in Hindustani system are marked by * . The rests in Carnatic system are written as .and ,
- The syllables used in both are quite different. In Hindustani, the syllables used are dha, ga, dhi, ge, dha, ka, ti, na, tun, tin, terikita, te. The syllables used in Carnatic are ta ki ta, ta ka di mi, ta ki ta taka di mi, ta ka ta ki ta and ta ka di mi ta ka ta ki ta. For takita, tajunu may also be used, for taka, jhunu may be used too.
- The speeds in Hindustani system are called Vilambit, Madhya and Drut. The speeds in Carnatic system are called Vilambam, Madhyamam and Dhritam. These are slow, medium and fast.
- Hindustani system has some exceptional tals or fractional tals expressed in terms of an integer and a fraction. They usually contain a grouping of 1 and a ½ beats at the end of the cycle. Some examples are ArdhaJaital, UpaDasi and Sawaritals which contain 2 or more groupings of 1 ½ matras , causing an irregular pattern.
- The Carnatic system also has irregular talams. They have no angalakshanam and are played with irregular taps. . They have no laghu, no jaati, no nadai. Only maatras exist in them. These are known as ChaapuTalams. They are of 4 types- TisraChapu talam-3+3=6 matras, KhandaChaputalam- 5+5=10 matras, Misrachaputalam- 7 +7=14 matras and SangeernaChaapuTalam- 9+9=18 matras.

- The Carnatic system has about 175 talams .The Simhanandatala is the longest Carnatic talam. The Hindustani system has about 350 tals.
- The concluding part of a 3 cycle rhythmic ending in Hindustani system is called Tihai, whereas in Carnatic system it is called Teermaanam.
- In Carnatic music, the yati, or decorative mathematical pattern is used as an important technique and is a hallmark of this particular music system. There are 6 major yatis:

        a. GoputchaYati
        b. SrotovaahaYati
        c. DamaruYati
        d. MridangaYati
        e. SamaYati
        f. VishamaYati 

- In Hindustani music also, the yati is used although the place of yati in Hindustani music is very limited.

This is the overview is a short layman’s approach to knowing the broad categorization of the Hindustani and Carnatic Tala systems of India. Of course, as we delve deeper into either of them, their understanding and evolution becomes more complicated and in depth.

 Ornamentation in Indian Classical Music (alankar)

 If you have a simple melody that can stand on its own, ornamentation is what is added to this to make it more appealing. There are many different kinds of ornaments (alankar) in Indian classical music. Some add finer nuances to the melody, others give it texture. Together, the various ornaments play a very important role in giving body and expressiveness to a simple melody, making it complete in and of itself without the need for accompaniment.

 This page introduces some of the main ornaments used in Indian classical and semi-classical music. For convenience, I focus on vocal music, but all of the ornaments below apply to instrumental music too.

 The ornaments are demonstrated using solfa syllables and explained using Indian musical notation, so please refer to the "Solfa Syllable" and "Notation ID" columns in this chart. I have also provided basic staff notation to illustrate each ornament for the benefit of non-Indian viewers, but please note that the symbols used are only approximations and cannot be interpreted exactly the way they would be in Western music.

****** Kan-swar

  Notes can be sung straight, but they are often sung with kan-swar (grace notes; literally "a small quantity of a note") borrowed from an adjacent note in a musical phrase. This lends mellifluousness and expressiveness to the melody. A kan-swar can be sung before or after the note it ornaments, and it can be borrowed from a note below or above it, but whatever the case, the main note is held for the longer duration while the kan-swar is more subtle. What kan-swar is used and when largely depends on the raga as well as the musical phrase in question, and it takes experience to know what sounds appropriate in which context.

  If I had to pick a single ornament that defines Indian classical music, it would be the kan-swar. Without the appropriate kan-swars, the melody no longer sounds Indian. All the other ornaments listed on this page are optional to some extent. You can sing simple compositions without gamaks or meends or khatkas, but take away the kan-swars, and the music is stripped of its essential identity.

****** Meend

  In its simplest form, a meend is a smooth glide from one note to another. During slower parts of a melody, kan-swars also become meends. However, meends can span much longer intervals too. Although a meend spanning a distance of several notes technically includes all the intermediate frequencies, only selected frequencies are given enough prominence as to be identified clearly. Sometimes only the starting and end notes of a meend can be clearly identified, but at other times, other specific notes are also given prominence. Not all meends travel directly from the starting to ending notes – some meends take circuitous paths, touching notes that do not fall between the notes in question.

******  Gamak

  Gamak is a word used to describe the sound of a drum; the vibration that happens when you strike the drumhead. As a musical ornament, it is a technique of singing a note with force in a way that creates a vibration, which adds a new dimension or texture to the music. In practice, the percussive effect of a gamak can be heard most effectively when several notes in succession are sung with force using a vowel sound at a brisk, even pace. Different kinds of gamak are possible in terms of the intensity and wavelength of the vibration and the quality of voice used.

****** Khatka

  A khatka is an ornament that involves performing a single note as a cluster of notes. The main note is featured most prominently, but a neighboring note or two are included as well. The main note is the note that can be sung straight in place of the khatka without affecting the underlying structure of the melody. Khatkas are very common, but their application is far from random. Different notes in different ragas lend themselves to the use of khatka, but not all the time. Experience teaches you when and on which notes a khatka sounds appropriate.

****** Andolan

  An andolan is a slow oscillation applied to a note. It usually features in ragas that use microtones and is applied to the notes in those ragas that involve the use of microtones. Microtones are unstable pitches that fall between two notes and are difficult to sustain. Artists can use this natural instability to their advantage by mastering the andolan and oscillating the note in a controlled fashion, rather like a graceful tight-rope walker.

******  Ornaments Used Mainly in Semi-Classical Music

  Some ornaments like murki and zamzama are very characteristic of Indian folk music and semi-classical forms of music that are influenced by or recently evolved from folk music, such as dadra, thumri, tappa and so on. They do also feature in mainstream classical music, but only very rarely.

******* Murki

   A murki is very much like a trill in that it usually involves two or three neighboring notes being alternated very swiftly and lightly. In fast-paced folk-derived compositions, murkis are rendered to sound light and sharp. In slower, more sensuous compositions, such as the thumri, they are smoothed over a bit, to sound more languid than sharp.
  
******* Zamzama

   A zamzama is an unevenly accented sequence of notes sung using sharp gamaks. The length of the notes in the sequence also varies, giving it a choppy effect. This ornament is very characteristic of folk music in the western parts of India, and also of a genre of semi-classical music called tappa which evolved from folk songs sung by camel riders in Punjab.

Mathematics in Sanskrit poetry

       It is interesting to observe that in Sanskrit poetry, the concept of binomial coeficients, Fibonacci numbers and binary numeration has been in use right from the days of Pingala who was the first to write a treatise on Chandas-shastra relating to metres in Sanskrit poetry.

    In Sanskrit poetry, we have stanzas with four quarters. Each quarter may have the same number of syllables or the same number of time units, a short one being assigned 1 time unit and a long one 2 time units.  There are metres in which the odd quarters have the same number of syllables or time units, while the even quarters have a different number of equal units.

         A Sanskrit stanza or padya consists of four padas or four quarters, which are regulated by

                      (i) The number of syllables in each quarter, or

                      (ii) The number of syllabic time units or matras, a short

                         sound being assigned one unit of time and the long one                                                                      .               two units of time.

   Each stanza or padya can thus be of two broad types, vritta or the one in which metre is regulated by the number and composition of syllables, and the other jati, where the metre is regulated by the number of syllabic instants or time units in each quarter.

   If all the padas are similar, the padya is called samavritta,; if alternate quarters are similar, it is called ardhasamavritta, and if all the quarters are dissimilar it is called vishamavritta.

   A syllable can be short or long; short vowels followed by anuswara or a visarga or a conjunct consonant are considered to be long. Any exceptions to this are generally granted as poetic licence to be exercised, depending upon the exigencies of the case.

    8 sets of triplets of long or short sounds or a mixture of both have been classified by Pingala and called ganas. He has chosen syllable triplets consisting of all short or all long or a mixture of these two sounds.   The interesting thing is that he has used the concept of binary numbers in place of the decimal numbers from 0 to 7. One does not know whether the present symbol for zero was known to him or not.  Assuming that he had used * for 0 and 1 for long sounds, his classification of ganas was as follows, (S standing for short and L for long sound units)

 An easy way to remember this is to use the mnemonic

Sa Na JaYaBhaRaTa Mey (which in Sanskrit would mean: He is  not my Jayabharata.        

        Pingala had considered how many patterns can be formed from a given number of syllables, for instance, how many patterns consist of 3 syllables, how many consist of 4 syllables and so on?  They can be of different types, all short or all long or a mixture of long and short sounds.  (Let S denote short sound and L denote long sound).  In other words, combinatorics or the principle of permutations/combinations and the binomial coefficients had a large role to play in this regard. We examine a few cases with a fixed number of syllables, long or short or a mixture of both.

     

      Pattern with 1 syllable (Long or short): L, S        No. of patterns = 2  =   21   

      Pattern with 2 syllables: (Long, short or mixture) LL, SS, LS, SL   No. of patterns = 4 = 22

      Pattern with 3 syllables: (Long, short or mixture)

          All short      SSS                                      No.of patterns = 1
          One short and two long:
            SLL, LLS, LSL, LLS,                           No. of patterns = 4
          One long and two short:
            LSS, SLS, SSL                                      No. of patterns = 3

                       Total number of patterns: 23 = 8.

                                                    Total umber of patterns = 26 = 32.

         As seen in the analysis, if each quarter contains 6 syllables, (long, short or a mixture of both), theoretically the number of possible metres is 26 = 64.     

     If each quarter is to contain 26 syllables (long, short or a mixture of both), the theoretic combination of syllables is 226 = 67,108,864.  If we consider cases where alternate quarters are similar or all are dissimilar, the number of possible metres becomes very large.  However, poets have used only a very limited number of metres. (Please see Appendix A and B for metres with constant number of syllables in each quarter, and metres with constant time units in each quarter, which poets have actually used).

 

      It is interesting to see that when the number of syllables is n (long, short or a mixture of both) the number of patterns follows the pattern of binomial coefficients in the expansion of (a + b)n, and the total number of patterns possible is 2n and when n = 4 it becomes = 16, and when n is 5, it becomes 32.  Further, for s short and l long syllables, or l short and s long syllables, the number of patterns available in this case of a total of s + l syllables is  the binomial coefficient s+l Cs =  s+lCl,. It looks strange that binomial coefficients should find some reference in Sanskrit poetry right from the early days.

       Now, we see the pattern for time units 1 to 6, taking 1 unit for short and 2 for long.

       Pattern with 1 short syllable: S                                               1    

       Pattern with 2 short syllables: SS, L                                       2

       Pattern with 3 short syllables: SSS. SL. LS                            3

       Pattern with 4 short syllables: SSSS, SSL. SLS, LSS, LL      5

       Pattern with 5 short syllables: SSSSS, SSSL, SSLS, SLSS.   8

       Pattern with 6 short syllables: SSSSSS, SSSSL, LSSSS,

                                                          SLSSS, SSLSS, SSSLS,

                                                          LLSS, SSLL, LSSL,               13

                                                          LLL,

                                                          SLSL, LSLS, SLLS

 

    When the number of time units is n, the number of patterns follows the Acharya Hemachandra-Gopala pattern of numbers, now known as the Fibonacci numbers, such that Fib(1) = 1, and (Fib(2) =2, and Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib (n-2), for all n > 2.  We thus see for n = 3, Fib(3) = 1 + 2 = 3; Fib (4) = 3+ 2 = 5; Fib(5) = 5 +3 = 8;  Fib (6) = 5 + 8 = 13.

    Acharya Hemadeva had noticed this and called this set of numbers as Hemadeva-Gopala numbers which are the forerunners for the Fibonacci numbers which came nearly 70 years later. Perhaps, Fibonacci drew his inspiration from this aspect of metres in Sanskrit poetry.  

    

    Pingala’s Chandas-shastra as well as Lilavati and Vrittaratnakara give directions for computing the number of possible varieties and finding their places or that of any single one in a regular enumeration of them.

    For instance, the number of padas and syllables in a few of the metres is as follows:

          Gayatri(tripada):     3 padas and 8 syllables in each

          Anushtup: 4 padas and 8 syllables in each

          Viraja:       4 padas and 10 syllables in each

          Trishtup:   4 padas and 11 syllables in each

          Jagati:        4 padas and 12 syllables in each.

    A well-known quantitative scheme in the traditional literature classifies the common metres according to the syllable count of a stanza, as multiples of 4, as follows:  

        Dwipadaviraja        20 syllables

        Gayatri:                  24 syllables

        Ushnik:                   28 syllables

        Anushtup:               32 syllables

        Brihati:                    36 syllables

        Pankti:                     40 syllables

        Trishtup:                  44 syllables

        Jagati:                       48 syllables.

There are many comprehensive schemes in the traditional literature, each distinct type of stanza carrying its own name.

        Metres with unequal number of syllables in different quarters

 

Udgata: 1st: SSL SLS SSL S (10) Sa, Ja, Sa, La)

             2nd: SSS SSL SLS L (10) (Na, Sa, Ja, Gu)

             3rd: LSS SSS SLS S L (11) (Bha, Na, Ja, La, Gu)

             4th: SSL SLS SSL SLS L (13) (Sa, Ja, Sa, Ja,gu)

                      In another variant: 3rd: LSS SSS LSS  L (10) (Bha, Na, Bha, Gu)

 

  There are metres where the number of syllables may vary in each quarter, and these are generally called Gathas, and this includes stanzas where the number of quarters may also be different from 4, or two or more quarters of a regular metre may be combined to form half-equal or unequal quarters.

 

Metres regulated by the number of syllabic instants or time units

or matra-chandas

The most common variety is:

1.Arya: 1st and 3rd quarters: 12 matras or time units

               2nd quarter: 18 time units

               4th quarter: 15 time units.

   This metre is said to have nine sub–divisions, the most common among them being the following: 

 

2.Geeti:  1st and 3rd quarters: 12 time units

               2nd and 4th quarters: 18 time units

3.Upageeti: 1st and 3rd quarters; 12 time units

                     2nd quarter: 15 time units

                     4th quarter: 18 time units

4.Udgeeti: 1st and 3rd quarters: 12 time units

                     2nd and 4th quarters: 20 time units

5.Aryageeti: 1st and 3rd quarters: 12 time units

                      2nd quarter: 15 time units

                      4th quarter: 18 time units

6.Vaitaleeya:1st and 3rd  quarters: 14 time units (6 syllabic instants followed by Ra and La and Gu or SLS and SL

     2nd and 4th quarters: 16 time units (8 syllabic instants followed by Ra, La, Gu or SLS SL

7.Aupachandasika: Here, the pattern is the same as above, except that at the end we have Ra and Ya (SLS and SLL); 1st and 3rd quarters: syllabic instants are not all to be short or long syllables. In each quarter, 2nd, 4th and 6th one should not be formed jointly with the next ones.

          Metres with constant number of time instants in each quarter

 

There are metres in which each quarter consists of 16 syllabic instants or time units, with the 9th one being short and the last being long.

 

(1)   Veenaakamsika: 9th and 12th instants: S

                           15th and 16th instants: L

       And the rest of the units are optional, short or long.

 

(2)   Chitra: 5th, 8th, 9th and 10th instants: S

                                          15 and 16th instants: L

 

(3)   Upachitra: 5th, 8th, 9th and 10th  instants: S

                                                  15th and 16th  instants: L; (The rest indeterminate)

   

(4)   Vishloka: 5th, 8th and 12th  instants : S

                                               15th and 16th  instants:  L (The rest indeterminate)

 If two or more varieties are contained in the same stanza, they are called Padakulaka, and there is no restriction except that each quarter should have 16 time units.

#+begin_quote
Puppets are silent. Materially speaking, their wooden, leather and felt bodies make no intentional sounds, only accidental ones, from the rustle of fabrics or slap of lifeless limbs against each other. Yet puppet performance involves all sorts of sounds and sonic practices. Not only do puppets speak, sing and dance, but they inhabit soundscapes rich with intentional sound and ambient music. Moreover, puppeteers adopt a kind of musical sensibility: they speak of breath and rhythm, and often describe playing with puppets as comparable to playing a musical instrument. This paper carves a space for puppetry within musicology by taking seriously this analogy between puppets and musical instruments. Drawing on discourses in organology and performance, this paper examines the symbolic and material dynamics between these two species of performance object as they are cast in the puppet theater of Viennese artist Richard Teschner (1879-1948).

Eίναι χυμένη από τη μουσική σας

Σας γέννησε και μέσα σας μιλάει

*** History of Cross-Cultural Transmission

https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Panchatantra

#+begin_quote
The Panchatantra approximated its current literary form within the fourth—sixth centuries C.E. According to Hindu tradition, the Panchatantra was written around 200 B.C.E. by Pandit Vishnu Sarma, a sage; however, no Sanskrit versions of the text before 1000 C.E. have survived.[16] One of the most influential Sanskrit contributions to world literature, it was exported (probably both in oral and literary formats) north to Tibet and China and east to South East Asia by Buddhist Monks on pilgrimage.[17]

According to the Shahnameh (The Book of the Kings, Persia's late tenth century national epic by Ferdowsi)[18] the Panchatantra also migrated westwards, during the Sassanid reign of Nushirvan around 570 C.E. when his famous physician Borzuy translated it from Sanskrit into the middle Persian language of Pahlavi, transliterated for Europeans as Kalile va Demne (a reference to the names of two central characters in the book).[19]

Karataka ('Horribly Howling') and Damanaka ('Victor') are the Sanskrit names of two jackals in the first section of the Panchatantra. They are retainers to a lion king and their lively adventures as well as the stories they and other characters tell one another make up roughly 45 percent of the book's length. By the time the Sanskrit version had migrated several hundred years through Pahlavi into Arabic, the two jackals' names had changed into Kalila and Dimna, and—probably because of a combination of first-mover advantage, Dimna's charming villainy and that dominant 45 percent bulk—their single part/section/chapter had become the generic, classical name for the whole book. It is possible, too, that the Sanskrit word 'Panchatantra' as a Hindu concept could find no easy equivalent in Zoroastrian Pahlavi.

From Borzuy's Pahlavi translation titled, Kalile va Demne, the book was translated into Syriac and Arabic—the latter by Ibn al-Muqaffa around 750 C.E. [20] under the Arabic title, Kalīla wa Dimma.[21]

Scholars aver that the second section of Ibn al-Muqaffa's translation, illustrating the Sanskrit principle of Mitra Laabha (Gaining Friends), became the unifying basis for the Brethren of Purity—the anonymous ninth century C.E. Arab encyclopedists whose prodigious literary effort, Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Sincerity, codified Indian, Persian and Greek knowledge.[22]

Philip K. Hitti in his History of the Arabs, proposes that:

    "The appellation is presumably taken from the story of the ringdove in Kalilah wa-Dimnah in which it is related that a group of animals by acting as faithful friends (ikhwan al-safa) to one another escaped the snares of the hunter. The story concerns a ring-dove and its companions who have become entangled in the net of a hunter seeking birds. Together, they left themselves and the ensnaring net to a nearby rat, who is gracious enough to gnaw the birds free of the net; impressed by the rat's altruistic deed, a crow becomes the rat's friend. Soon a tortoise and gazelle also join the company of animals. After some time, the gazelle is trapped by another net; with the aid of the others and the good rat, the gazelle is soon freed, but the tortoise fails to leave swiftly enough and is himself captured by the hunter. In the final turn of events, the gazelle repays the tortoise by serving as a decoy and distracting the hunter while the rat and the others free the tortoise. After this, the animals are designated as the Ikwhan al-Safa.[23]

This story is mentioned as an exemplum when the Brethren speak of mutual aid in one rasa'il (treatise), a crucial part of their system of ethics that has been summarized thus:

    "And their virtues, equally, are not the virtues of Islam, not so much righteousness and the due quittance of obligations, as mildness and gentleness towards all men, forgiveness, long-suffering, and compassion, the yielding up of self for others' sake. In this Brotherhood, self is forgotten; all act by the help of each, all rely upon each for succour and advice, and if a Brother sees it will be good for another that he should sacrifice his life for him, he willingly gives it. No place is found in the Brotherhood for the vices of the outside world; envy, hatred, pride, avarice, hypocrisy, and deceit, do not fit into their scheme,—they only hinder the worship of truth."[24]

After the Muslim invasion of Persia (Iran) Ibn al-Muqaffa's 750 C.E. Arabic version (by now two languages removed from its pre-Islamic Sanskrit original) emerges as the pivotal surviving text that enriches world literature.[25]

From Arabic it was transmitted in 1080 C.E. to Greece, and in 1252 into Spain (old Castillian, Calyla e Dymna) and thence to the rest of Europe. However, it was the ca. 1250 Hebrew translation attributed to Rabbi Joel that became the source (via a subsequent Latin version done by one John of Capua around 1270 C.E., Directorium Humanae Vitae, or "Directory of Human Life") of most European versions. Furthermore, in 1121, a complete 'modern' Persian translation from Ibn al-Muqaffa's version flows from the pen of Abu'l Ma'ali Nasr Allah Munshi.
Content

Each distinct part of the Panchatantra contains "at least one story, and usually more, which are 'emboxed' in the main story, called the 'frame-story'. Sometimes there is a double emboxment; another story is inserted in an 'emboxed' story. Moreover, the [whole] work begins with a brief introduction, which as in a frame all five … [parts] are regarded as 'emboxed'." Vishnu Sarma's idea was that humans can assimilate more about their own habitually unflattering behavior if it is disguised in terms of entertainingly configured stories about supposedly less illustrious beasts than themselves.[26]

Professor Edgerton challenges the assumption that animal fables function mainly as adjuncts to religious dogma, acting as indoctrination devices to condition the moral behavior of small children and obedient adults. He suggests that in the Panchatantra, "Vishnu Sarma undertakes to instruct three dull and ignorant princes in the principles of polity, by means of stories …. [This is] a textbook of artha, 'worldly wisdom', or niti, polity, which the Hindus regard as one of the three objects of human desire, the other being dharma, 'religion or morally proper conduct' and kama 'love' …. The so-called 'morals' of the stories have no bearing on morality; they are unmoral, and often immoral. They glorify shrewdness, practical wisdom, in the affairs of life, and especially of politics, of government."

The text's political realism explains why the original Sanskrit villain jackal, the decidedly jealous, sneaky and evil vizier-like Damanaka ('Victor') is his frame-story's winner, and not his noble and good brother Karataka who is presumably left 'Horribly Howling' at the vile injustice of Part One's final murderous events. In fact, in its steady migration westward the persistent theme of evil-triumphant in Kalila and Dimna, Part One frequently outraged Jewish, Christian and Muslim religious leaders—so much so, indeed, that ibn al-Muqaffa carefully inserts (no doubt hoping to pacify the powerful religious zealots of his own turbulent times) an entire extra chapter at the end of Part One of his Arabic masterpiece, putting Dimna in jail, on trial and eventually to death.

Needless to say there is no vestige of such dogmatic moralizing in the collations that remain to us of the pre-Islamic original—the Panchatantra.

Was Homer den Zigeunern sagt

    Aktualisiert am 15.05.2006-12:00

Man darf sich also getrost mit Kittler an Bradford halten, den Hölscher nicht nennt. Ähnliche Erfahrungen sind bei Gelegenheit der Pythagoräer, insonderheit Philolaos zu machen. Manch einer erinnert sich des einst berühmten Buches von Erich Frank "Platon und die sogenannten Pythagoräer" (1923) und des fulminanten Nachweises der Philolaos-Fragmente als Fälschungen. Aber dann muß man feststellen, daß sowohl Kirk/Raven/Schofield (1994) als auch schon Heinrich Dörrie im Kleinen Pauly (1972) zu Philolaos Erich Frank ebensowenig erwähnen, wie das Kittler tut.

Das mag viel oder wenig besagen. Doch so sehr man einerseits Grund hat, Kittlers Hinweise ernst zu nehmen, so notwendig ist es auch, ihnen wirklich nachzugehen. Dies gilt etwa für den Abschnitt, in dem Kittler mit dem ganzen Hochgefühl des Wüstlings Dinge anspricht, von denen er ironisch sagt, daß sie "für Jugendliche unter achtzehn Jahren nicht geeignet" seien. Tatsächlich geht es um die Deutung des Buchstabens E (Epsilon) am Haus Apolls in Delphi. Darüber hat Plutarch einen Dialog verfaßt, und in diesem Dialog taucht eine Interpretation auf, die man obszön nennen kann und die sich aus Deutung einer Figur in der Tetraktys der Pythagoräer ergibt. Konrat Ziegler freilich, der Übersetzer dieses Dialogs (1951), erwähnt in seinem monumentalen Realenzyklopädie-Artikel über Plutarch von 1963 davon nichts, kommt aber hier zu dem Schluß, daß die von dem kaiserzeitlichen Historiker zusammengetragenen Deutungsversuchde des E "samt und sonders wissenschaftlich nicht ernst zu nehmen sind".

Ein Heidegger-Enthusiast muß vor solchem Dictum nicht zurückschrecken. "Die Wissenschaft denkt nicht", hat der Mann aus Meßkirch immerhin gesagt. Allerdings hat er dann doch das besinnliche und rechnende Denken unterschieden und letzteres durchaus ernst genommen. Mit der Mathematik und Aphrodite ist nicht so leicht ein vertrauenstiftendes Pärchen zu bilden. Und wenn Kittler auch dem Wort Heideggers, es müsse die Natur ja nicht für alle Zeiten die Natur der modernen Physik bleiben, den Satz zur Seite stellen wollte, es müsse auch die Schrift, in der das Buch der Natur geschrieben sei, nicht für alle Zeiten die Mathematik der Moderne sein, so käme er damit doch seiner Begeisterung für Turing und die Welt der Computer in die Quere.

Da wird, wer Kittlers Buch schließlich beendet, sich von den Ergebnissen aus dem Vortrag schwerlich haben überzeugen lassen und auf die weiteren Bände des weit konzipierten Werks warten müssen. Dennoch, es geht einem wohl mit Kittler wie mit seinem Freund Klaus Theweleit. Den behaupteten Entdeckungen gegenüber bleibt man mehr als skeptisch. Aber nach dem Durchgang durch das zu ihrer Darlegung beigeschaffte Material hat man einen anderen Blick auf die Dinge bekommen. Dem sollte man nicht unbedingt trauen. Indes, da gebildete Menschen seit zweitausend Jahren wenig anderes tun, als sich immer wieder diese Bücher und Autoren vorzunehmen, erscheint manche zusätzliche Verwirrung nützlicher als pedantische Vorgaben zum Einverständnis, wo die vielen immer schon einverstanden waren. Oder, um es mit Paul Scheerbart zu sagen: "Charakter ist nur Eigensinn, / es lebe die Zigeunerin."

ON THE 'E'* AT DELPHI
Browne's Miscellany Tract On Oracles

(In the Pronaos of the temple at Delphi the visitor was confronted by certain inscriptions (γράμματα): 'Know thyself' — 'Nothing too much' — 'Go bail and woe is at hand' — all exhortations to wisdom or prudence (Plato, Charmides, 163-4). To these is to be added, on the sole authority of Plutarch's Dialogue,** the letter E, pronounced EI.)

THE SPEAKERS

AMMONIUS, the Platonist philosopher, Plutarch's teacher.
LAMPRIAS, Plutarch's brother.
PLUTARCH.
THEON, a literary friend.
EUSTROPHUS, an Athenian.
NICANDER, a priest of the temple.

I. A day or two ago, dear Serapion, I met with some rather good lines, addressed, Dicaearchus thinks, to Archelaus by Euripides:3

    No gifts, my wealthy friend, from humble me;
    You'll think me fool, or think I did but beg. 

He who out of his narrow store offers trifles to men of great possessions, confers no favour; no one believes that he gives something for nothing, and he gets credit for a jealous and ungenerous temper. Now surely as money presents fall far below those of literature and learning, so there is beauty in giving these, and beauty in claiming a return in kind. At any rate, I am sending to you, and so to my friends down there, some of our Pythian Dialogues, as a sort of first-fruits; and in doing so, confess that I expect others from you, and more and better ones, since you enjoy a great city4 and abundant leisure, with many books and discussions of every sort. Well, then, our kind Apollo, in the oracles which he gives his consultants, seems to solve the problems of life and to find a remedy, while problems of the intellect he actually suggests and propounds to the born love of wisdom in the soul, thus implanting an appetite which leads to truth. Among other instances, this is made clear as to the consecration of the letter 'E'. We may well guess that it was not by chance, or by lot, that, along among the letters, it received pre-eminence in the God's house, and took rank as a sacred offering and a show object. No, the officials of the God in early times, when they came to speculate, either saw in it a special and extraordinary virtue, or found it a symbol for something else of serious importance, and so adopted it. I had often myself avoided the question and quietly declined it when raised in the school. However, I was lately surprised by my sons in earnest discussion with certain strangers, who were just starting from Delphi; it was not decent to put them off with excuses, they were so anxious to receive some account. We sat down near the temple, and I began to raise questions with myself, and to put others to them; and the place, and what they said, reminded me of a discussion which we heard a long time ago from Ammonius and others, at the time of Nero's visit, when the same problem had been stated in the same way.

II. That the God is no less philosopher than he is prophet appeared to all to come out directly from the exposition which Ammonius gives us of each of his names. He is 'Pythian' (The Inquirer) to those who are beginning to learn and to inquire; 'Delian' (The Clear One) and 'Phanaean' to those who are already getting something clear and a glimmering of the truth; 'Ismenian' (The Knowing) to those who possess the knowledge; 'Leschenorian' (God of Discourse) when they are in active enjoyment of dialectical and philosophic intercourse. 'Now since,' he continued, 'Philosophy embraces inquiry, wonder, and doubt, it seems natural that most of the things relating to the God should have been hidden away in riddles, and should require some account of their purpose, and an explanation of the cause. For instance, in the case of the undying fire, why the only woods used here are pine for burning and laurel for fumigation;5 again, why two Fates are here installed, whereas their number is everywhere else taken as three; why no woman is allowed to approach the place of the oracles; questions about the tripod, and the rest. These problems when suggested to persons not altogether wanting in reason and soul, lure them on, and challenge them to inquire, to listen, and to discuss. Look again at those inscriptions, KNOW THYSELF and NOTHING TOO MUCH; how many philosophic inquiries have they provoked! What a multitude of arguments has sprung up out of each, as from a seed! Not one of them I think is more fruitful in this way than the subject of our present inquiry.'

III. When Ammonius had said this, my brother Lamprias spoke: 'After all, the account which we have heard of the matter is simple enough and quite short. They say that the famous Wise Men, also called by some "Sophists", were properly only five, Chilon, Thales, Solon, Bias, and Pittacus. But Cleobulus, tyrant of Lindos, and, later on, Periander of Corinth, men with no wisdom or virtue in them, but forcing public opinion by influence, friends, and favours, thrust themselves into the list of the wise, and disseminated through Greece maxims and sayings resembling the utterances of the five. Then the five were vexed, but did not choose to expose the imposture, or to have an open quarrel on the matter of title, and to fight it out with such powerful persons. They met here by themselves; and after discussing the matter, dedicated the letter which is fifth in the alphabet, and also as a number signifies five, thus making their own protest before the God, that they were five, discarding and rejecting the seventh and the sixth, as having no part or lot with themselves.6 That this account is not beside the mark may be recognized by any one who has heard the officials of the temple naming the golden "E" as that of Livia the wife of Cæsar, the brazen one as that of the Athenians, whereas the original and oldest letter, which is of wood, is to this day called that "Of the Wise Men", as having been offered of all in common, not of any one of them.'

IV. Ammonius gave a quiet smile; he had a suspicion that Lamprias had been giving us a view of his own, making up history and legend at discretion. Some one else said that it was like the nonsense which they had heard from the Chaldæan stranger a day or so before; that there were seven letters which were vowels, seven stars that have an independent motion and are unattached to the heavens; moreover that 'E' is the second vowel from the beginning, and the sun the second planet, after the moon, and that all Greeks, or nearly all, identify Apollo with the sun.

'But all that', he said, 'is pernicious nonsense. Lamprias, however, has, probably without knowing it, made a move7 which stirs up all who have to do with the temple against his view. What he told us was unknown to any of the Delphians; they used to give the regular guides' account, that neither the appearance nor the sound of the letter has any significance, but only the name.'

V. 'No, the Delphic Officials', said Nicander the priest, speaking for them, 'believe that it is a vehicle, a form assumed by the petition addressed to the God; it has a leading place in the questions of those who consult him, and inquire,8 If they shall conquer; If they shall marry; If it is advisable to sail; If to farm; If to travel. The God in his wisdom would bow out the dialecticians9 when they think that nothing practical comes of the "If" part with its clause attached; he admits as practical, in his sense of the word, all questions so attached. Then, since it is our personal concern to question him as prophet, but a general concern to pray to him as God, they hold that the letter embraces the virtue of prayer no less than that of inquiry; "O, If I might!" says every one who prays, as Archiolochus,10

    If it might be mine, prevailing, Neobule's hand to touch! 

When If-so-be11 is used, the latter part is dragged in (compare Sophron's "Bereaved of children, I trow"12, or Homer's "As I will break thy might, I trow"13). But If gives the sense of prayer sufficiently.'

VI. When Nicander had finished, our friend Theon, whom I am sure you know, asked Ammonius whether Dialectic might speak freely, after the insulting remarks to which she had been treated. Ammonius told him to speak out on her behalf. 'That the God is a master of Dialectic,' Theon said, 'is shown clearly by most of his oracles; for you will grant that the solution of puzzles belongs to the same person as their invention. Again, as Plato used to say, when a response was given that the altar at Delos should be doubled,14 a matter requiring the most advanced geometry, the God was not merely enjoining this, but was also putting his strong command upon the Greeks to practice geometry. Just so, when the God puts out ambiguous oracles, he is exalting and establishing Dialectic, as essential to the right understanding of himself. You will grant again, that in Dialectic this conjunctive particle has great force, because it formulates the most logical of all sentences. This is certainly the "conjunctive", seeing that the other animals know the existence of things, but man alone has been gifted by nature with the power of observing and discerning their sequence. That "it is day" and "it is light" we may take it that wolves and dogs and birds perceive. But "if it is day it is light", is intelligible only to man; he alone can apprehend antecedent and consequent, the enunciation of each and their connexion, their mutual relation and difference, and it is in these that all demonstration has its first and governing principle. Since then Philosophy is concerned with truth, and the light of truth is demonstration, and the principle of demonstration is the conjunctive proposition, the faculty which includes and produces this was rightly consecrated by the wise men to that God who is above all things a lover of truth. Also, the God is a prophet, and prophetic art deals with that future which is to come out of things present or things past. Nothing comes into being without a cause, nothing is known beforehand without a reason. Things which come into being follow things which have been, things which are to be follow things which now are coming into being, all bound in one continuous chain of evolution. Therefore he who knows how to link causes together into one, and combine them into a natural process, can also declare beforehand things15

    Which are, which shall be, and which were of old. 

Homer did well in putting the present first, the future next, and the past last. Inference starts with the present, and works by the force of the conjunction: "If this is, that was its antecedent", "If this is, that will be". As we have said, the technical and logical requirement is knowledge of consequence; sense supplies the minor premiss. Hence, though it may perhaps seem a petty thing to say, I will not shrink from it; the real tripod of truth is the logical process which assumes the relation of consequent to antecedent, then introduces the fact, and so establishes the conclusion. If the Pythian God really finds pleasure in music, and in the voices of swans, and the tones of the lyre, what wonder is it that as a friend to Dialectic, he should welcome and love that part of speech which he sees philosophers use more, and more often, than any other. So Hercules, when he had not yet loosed Prometheus, nor yet conversed with the sophists Chiron and Atlas, but was young and just a Boeotian, first abolished Dialectic, made a mock at the "If the first then the second",16 and bethought him to remove the tripod by force, and to try conclusions with the God for his art. At any rate, as time went on, he also appears to have become a great prophet and a great dialectician.'

VII. When Theon had done, I think it was Eustrophus of Athens who addressed us: 'Do you see with what a will Theon backs Dialectic? He has only to put on the lion's skin! Now then for you who put down under number all things in one mass, all natures and principles divine as well as human, and take it to be leader and lord in all that is beautiful and honourable! It is n time for you to keep quiet; offer to the god a first-fruits of your dear Mathematics, if you think that "E" rises above the other letters, not in its own right by power or shape, or by its meaning as a word, but as the honoured symbol of an absolutely great and sovereign number, the "Pempad", from which the Wise Men took their verb "to count".17 Eustrophus was not jesting when he said this to us; he said it because I was at the time passionately devoted to Mathematics, though soon to find the value of the maxim, 'NOTHING TOO MUCH', having joined the Academy.

VIII. So I said that Eustrophus' solution of the problem by number was excellent. 'For since,' I continued, 'when all number is divided into even and odd, unity alone is in its effect common to both, and therefore, if added to an odd number makes it even, and vice versa;18 and since even numbers start with two, odd numbers with three, and five is produced by combination of these, it has rightly received honour as the product of first principles, and it has further been called "Marriage", because even resembles the female, odd the male. For when we divide the several numbers into equal segments, the even parts asunder perfectly, and leaves inside a sort of recipient principle or space; if the odd is treated the same way, a middle part is always left over, which is generative. Hence the odd is the more generative, and when brought into combination invariably prevails; in no combination does it give an even result, but in all cases an odd.19 Moreover, when each is applied to itself and added, the difference is shown. Even with even never gives odd, or passes out of its proper nature; it wants the strength to produce anything different. Odd numbers with odd yield even numbers in plenty because of their unfailing fertility. The other powers of numbers and their distinctions cannot be now pursued in detail. However, the Pythagoreans called five "Marriage", as produced by the union of the first male number and the first female. From another point of view it has been called "Nature", because when multiplied into itself it ends at last in itself. For as Nature takes a grain of wheat, and in the intermediate stages of growth gives forms and shapes in abundance, through which she brings her work to perfection, and, after them all, shows us again a grain of wheat, thus restoring the beginning in the end of the whole process, so it is with numbers. When other numbers are multiplied into themselves they end in different numbers after being squared; only those formed of five or six recover and preserve themselves every time. Thus six times six gives thirty-six, five times five twenty-five. And again, a number formed of six does this only once, in the single case of being squared. Five has the same property in multiplication, and also a special property of its own when added to itself; it produces alternately itself or ten, and that to infinity. For this number mimics the principle which orders all things. As Heraclitus tells us that Nature successively produces the universe out of herself and herself out of the universe, bartering "fire for things and things for fire, as goods for gold and gold for goods", even so it is with the Pempad. In union with itself, it does not by its nature produce anything imperfect or foreign. All its changes are defined; it either produces itself or the Decad, either the homogeneous or the perfect.

IX. 'Then if any one ask "What is all this to Apollo?"20 Much, we will answer, not to Apollo only but also to Dionysus, who has no less to do with Delphi than has Apollo. Now we hear theologians saying or singing, in poems or in plain prose, that the God subsists indestructible and eternal, and that, by force of some appointed plan and method, he passes through changes of his person; at one time he sets fire to Nature and so makes all like unto all, at another passes through all phases of difference — shapes, sufferings, powers — at the present time, for instance, he becomes "Cosmos", and that is his most familiar name. The wiser people disguise from the vulgar the change into fire, and call him "Apollo" from his isolation,21 "Phoebus" from his undefiled purity. As for his passage and distribution into waves and water, and earth, and stars, and nascent plants and animals, they hint at the actual change undergone as a rending and dismemberment, but name the God himself Dionysus or Zagreus or Nyctelius or Isodaites. Deaths too and vanishings do they construct, passages out of life and new births, all riddles and tales to match the changes mentioned. So they sing to Dionysus dithyrambic strains, charged with sufferings and a change wherein are wanderings and dismemberment. For Aeschylus says:22

    In mingled cries the dithyramb should ring,
    With Dionysus revelling, its King. 

'But Apollo has the Pæan, a set and sober music. Apollo is ever ageless and young; Dionysus has many forms and many shapes as represented in paintings and sculpture, which attribute to Apollo smoothness and order and a gravity with no admixture, to Dionysus a blend of sport and sauciness with seriousness and frenzy:

    God that sett'st maiden's blood
    Dancing in frenzied mood,
    Blooming with pageantry!
    Evoe! we cry 

'So do they summon him, rightly catching the character of either change. But since the periods of change are not equal, that called "satiety" being longer, that of "stint" shorter, they here preserve a proportion, and use the Pæan with their sacrifice for the rest of the year, but at the beginning of winter revive the dithyramb, and stop the Pæan, and invoke this God instead of the other, supposing that this ratio of three to one is that of the "Arrangement" to the "Conflagration".23

X. 'But perhaps this has been drawn out at too great length for the present opportunity. This much is clear, that they do associate the pempad with the God, as it now produces its own self like fire, and again produces the Decad out of itself like the universe. Now take music, which the God favours so highly: are we not to suppose that this number has its share here?

'Most of the science of harmonies, to put it in a word, is concerned with consonances. That these are five and no more is proved by reason, as against the man who is all for strings and holes, and wants to explore these points irrationally by the senses: they all have their origin in numerical ratios. The ratio of the fourth is four to three, of the fifth three to two, of the octave two to one, of the octave and fifth three to one, of the double octave four to one. The additional consonance which writers of harmony introduce under the name of octave and fourth, does not merit admission, being extra-metrical; to admit it would be to indulge the irrational side of our sense of hearing, and to violate reason, or law. Passing by then five arrangements of tetrachords, and the first five "tones", or "tropes", or "harmonies", whichever name is right, by variations of which, made higher or lower, the remaining scales, high and low, are produced, is it not true that, though intervals are many, indeed infinite, the principles of melody are five only, quarter tone, half tone, tone, tone and a half, double tone? In sounds no other interval of high and low, be it smaller or greater, can be used for melody.

XI. 'Passing over many similar points, I will', I said, 'adduce Plato,24 who, in discussing the question of a single universe, says that if there are others besides ours, and it is not alone, then the whole number of them is five and no more; not but that, if ours is the only universe in being, as Aristotle25 also thinks, even this one is in a fashion composite and formed out of five; one of earth, one of water, a third of fire, and a fourth of air, while the fifth is called heaven or light or air, or by others "fifth essence"26 to which alone of all bodies circular motion is natural, not due to force or other accidental cause. Therefore it is that Plato, observing the five perfect figures of Nature — Pyramid, Cube, Octahedron, Eicosahedron, and Dodecahedron — assigned them to the elements, each to each.

XII. 'There are some who appropriate to the same elements our own senses, also five in number. Touch, as they see, is resistent and earthy. Taste takes in properties by moisture in the things tasted. Air when struck becomes audible voice or sound. There remain two: smell, the object of our olfactory sense, is an exhalation engendered by heat, and so resembles a fire; sight is akin to air and light, which give it a luminous passage, so there is a commixture of both which is sympathetic. Besides these, the animal has no other sense, and the universe no other substance, which is simple and not blended. A marvellous apportionment of the five to the five!'

Here, I think, I paused, and after an interval I went on: 'What has happened to us, Eustrophus? We have almost forgotten Homer,27 as if he had not been the first to divide the universe into five parts, assigning the three in the middle to the extremes, Olympus and earth, one the limit of what is below, the other of what is above. "We must cry back", as Euripides says.28 Now those who exalt the number four29 as the basis of the genesis of every body, make out a fairly good case. For every solid body possesses length, breadth, and depth; but length presupposes a point as an unit; the line is called length without breadth, and is length; the movement of a line in breadth produces a plane surface, and that is three; add depth, and we get to a solid with four factors. Any one can see that the number four carries Nature up to this point, that is, to the formation of a complete body, which may be touched, weighed, or struck; there it has left her, wanting in what is greatest. For that which has no soul is, in plain terms, orphaned and incomplete and fit for nothing, unless it be employed by soul. But the movement or disposition which sets soul therein — a change introducing a fifth factor — restores to Nature her completeness, its rational basis is as much more commanding than that of the Tetrad as the animal is above the inanimate. Further, the symmetry and potency of the whole five prevails, so as not to allow the animate to form classes without limit, but gives five types for all living things. There are Gods, we know, and dæmons, and heroes, and after these, fourth in all, the race of men: fifth, and last, the irrational order of brutes. Again, if you make a natural division of the soul itself, the first and least distinct principle is that of growth; second is that of sense, then comes appetite, then the spirited part; when it has reached the power of reasoning and perfected its nature, it stays at rest in the fifth stage as its upper limit.

XIV. 'Now as this number five has powers so many and so great, its origin is also noble: not the process already described, out of the numbers two and three, but that given by the combination of the first principle of number with the first square. The first principle is unity, the first square is four; from these as from idea and limited substance, comes five. Or, if it be really correct, as some hold, to reckon unity as a square, being a power of itself and working out to itself, then the Pempad is formed out of the first two squares, and so has not missed noble birth and that the highest.

XV. 'My most important point', I went on, 'may, I fear, bear hardly on Plato, just as he said that Anaxagoras "was hardly used by the name of Selene", when he had wished to appropriate the theory of her illumination, really a very old one. Are not these Plato's words, in the Cratylus?'30 'They certainly are', said Eustrophus, 'but I fail to see the resemblance.' 'Very well then; you know, I suppose, that in the Sophist he proves that the supreme principles are five:31 being, identity, difference, and after these, as fourth and fifth, movement and position. But in the Philebus he divides on a different plan.32 He distinguishes the unlimited and the limited, from whose combination comes the origin of all being. The cause of combination he takes to be a fourth. The fifth, whereby things so mingled are again parted and distinguished, he has left us to guess. I conjecture that those on the one list are figures of those on the other; to being corresponds that which becomes, to motion the unlimited; to position the limited, to identity the combining principle, to difference that which distinguishes. But if the two sets are different, yet, on one view as on the other, there would be five classes, and five modes of difference. Some early inquirer, it will surely be said, saw into this before Plato, and consecrated two "E's" to the God, as a manifestation and symbol of the number of all things. But further, having perceived that the good also takes shape under five heads, firstly moderation, secondly symmetry, thirdly mind, fourthly the sciences and arts and true opinions which relate to soul, fifthly every pleasure which is pure and unmingled with what causes pain, he there leaves off, merely suggesting the Orphic verse,

    In the sixth order let the strain be stayed! 

XVI. 'Having said so much', I went on, to you all, I will sing one short stave to Nicander and "his cunning men".

'On the sixth day of the new moon, when the Pythia is introduced into Prytaneum by one person, the first of your three castings of lot is a single one, namely the five: the three against the two.'33 'It is so,' said Nicander, 'but the reason may not be disclosed to others.' 'Then', I answered with a smile, 'until such time as we become priests, and the God allows us to know the truth, this much and no more shall be added to what we have to say about the Pempad.'34 Such, so far as I remember, was the end of the arithmetical or mathematical reasons for extolling the letter 'E'.

XVII. Ammonius, as one who himself gave Mathematics no mean place in Philosophy, was pleased at the course the conversation was taking, and said: 'It is not worth our while to answer our young friends with too absolute accuracy on these points; I will only observe that any one of the numbers will provide not a few points for those who choose to sing its praises. Why speak about the others? Apollo's holy "Seven" will take up all one day before we have exhausted its powers. Are we then to show the Seven Wise Men at odds with common usage, and "the time which runs",35 and to suppose that they ousted the "Seven" from its pre-eminence before the God, and consecrated the "Five" as perhaps more appropriate?

'My own view is that the letter signifies neither number, nor order, nor conjunction, nor any other omitted part of speech; it is a complete and self-operating mode of addressing the God; the word once spoken brings the speaker into apprehension of his power. The God, as it were, addresses each of us, as he enters, with his "KNOW THYSELF", which is at least as good as "Hail". We answer the God back with "EI" (Thou Art),36 rendering to him the designation which is true and has no lie in it, and alone belongs to him, and to no other, that of BEING.

XVIII. 'For we have, really, no part in real being; all mortal nature is in a middle state between becoming and perishing, and presents but an appearance, a faint unstable image, of itself. If you strain the intellect, and wish to grasp this, it is as with water; compress it too much and force it violently into one space as it tries to flow through, and you destroy the enveloping substance; even so when the reason tries to follow out too closely the clear truth about each particular thing in a world of phase and change, it is foiled, and rests either on the becoming of that thing or on its perishing; it cannot apprehend anything which abides or really is. "It is impossible to go into the same river twice", said Heraclitus;37 no more can you grasp mortal being twice, so as to hold it. So sharp and so swift its change; it scatters and brings together again, nay not again, no nor afterwards; even while it is being formed it fails, it approaches, and it its gone. Hence becoming never ends in being, for the process never leaves off, or is stayed. From seed it produces, in its constant changes, an embryo, then an infant, then a child; in due order a boy, a young man; then a man, an elderly man, an old man; it undoes the former becomings and the age which has been, to make those which come after. yet we fear (how absurdly!) a single death, we who have died so many deaths, and yet are dying. For it is not only that, as Heraclitus38 would say, "death of fire is birth of air", and "death of air is birth of water"; the thing is much clearer in our own selves. The man in his strength is destroyed when the old man comes into being, the young man was destroyed for the man in his strength to be, so the boy for the young man, the babe for the boy. He of yesterday has died unto him of to-day; he of to-day is dying unto him of to-morrow. No one abides, no one is; we that come into being are many, while matter is driven around, and then glides away, about some one appearance and a common mould. Else how is it, if we remain the same, that the things in which we find pleasure now are different from those of a former time; that we love, hate, admire, and censure different things; that our words are different and our feelings; that our look, our bodily form, our intellect are not the same now as then? If a man does not change, these various conditions are unnatural; if he does change, he is not the same man. But if he is not the same man, he is not at all; his so-called being is simply change and new birth of man out of man. In our ignorance of what being is, sense falsely tells us that what appears is.

XIX. 'What then really is? That which is eternal, was never brought into being, is never destroyed, to which no time ever brings change. Time is a thing which moves and takes the fashion of moving matter, which ever flows or is a sort of leaky vessel which holds destruction and becoming. Of time we use the words "afterwards", "before", "shall be", and "has been", each on its face an avowal of not being. For, in this question of being, to say of a thing which has not yet come into being, or which has already ceased from being, that "it is", is silly and absurd. When we strain to the uttermost our apprehension of time, and say "it is at hand", "it is here", or "now", a rational development of the argument brings it all to nothing. "Now" is squeezed out into the future or into the past, as though we should try to see a point, which of necessity passes away to right or left. But if the case be the same with Nature, which is measured, as with time which measures, nothing in it abides or really is. All things are coming into being, or being destroyed, even while we measure them by time. Hence it is not permissible, even in speaking of that which is, to say that "it was", or "it shall be"; these all are inclinations, transitions, passages, for of permanent being there is none in Nature.

XX. 'But the God IS, we are bound to assert, he is, with reference to no time but to that age wherein is no movement, or time, or duration; to which nothing is prior or subsequent; no future, no past, no elder, no younger, which by one long "now" has made the "always" perfect. Only with reference tot his that which really is, is; it has not come into being, it is not yet to be, it did not begin, it will not cease. Thus then we ought to hail him in worship, and thus to address him as "Thou Art", aye, or in the very words of some of the old people, "Ei Hen", "Thou art one thing".39 For the Divine is not many things, in the sense in which each one of us is made up of ten thousand different and successive states, a scrap-heap of units, a mob of individuals. No, that which is must be one, as that is which is one is. Variety, any difference in being, passes to one side to produce that which is not. Therefore the first of the names of the God, and the second, and the third. "Apollo" (Not-many) denies plurality and excludes multitude. Ἴητος means one and one only;40 Phoebus, we know, is a word by which the ancients expressed that which is clean and pure, even as to this day the Thessalians, when their priests pass their solemn days in strict seclusion outside the temple, apply to them a verb formed from Phoebus. Now The One is transparent and pure, pollution comes by commixture of this with that, just as Homer,41 you remember, says of ivory dyed red that it is stained, and dyers say of mingled pigments that they are destroyed, and call the process "destruction". Therefore it is the property of that which is indestructible and pure to be one and without admixture.

XXI. 'There are those who think that Apollo and the sun are the same; we hail them and love them for the fair name they give, and it is fitting to do so; for they associate their idea of the God with that which they honour and desire more than all other things which they know. But now that we see them dreaming of the God in the fairest of nightly visions, let us rise and encourage them to mount yet higher, to contemplate him in a dream of the day, and to see his own being. Let them pay honour also to the image of him and worship the principle of increase which is about it; so far as what is of sense can lead to what is of mind, a moving body to that which abides, it allows presentments and appearances of his kind and blessed self to shine through after a fashion. But as to transitions and changes in himself, that he now discharges fire, and so is drawn up, as they put it, or again presses down and strains himself into earth and sea, winds and animals, and all the strange passages into animals and also plants, piety forbids us so much as to hear them. Otherwise the God will be a greater trifler than the boy in Homer,42 for ever playing with the universe the game which the boy plays with a pile of sand, which is heaped together and sucked away under his hand; moulding the universe when there is none, and again destroying it when it has come into being. The opposite principle which we find in the universe, whatever its origin, is that which binds beings together and prevails over the corporeal weakness tending to destruction. To my thinking the word "EI" is confronted with this false view, and testifies to the God that THOU ART, meaning that no shift or change has place in him, but that such things belong to some other God, or rather to some Spirit set over Nature in its perishing and becoming, whether to effect either process or to undergo it. This appears from the names, in themselves opposite and contradictory. He is called Apollo, another is called Pluto; he is Delius (apparent), the other Aidoneus (invisible); he is Phoebus (bright), the other Skotios (full of darkness); by his side are the Muses, and Memory, with the other are Oblivion and Silence; he is Theorius and Phanæus, the other is "King of dim Night and ineffectual Sleep."43 The other is

    Of all the Gods to men the direst foe.44 

Whereas of him Pindar45 has pleasantly said:

    Well tried and mildest found, to men who live and die. 

so Euripides46 was right:

    Draughts to the dead out-poured,
    Songs which our bright-haired lord
    Apollo hath abhorred. 

And still earlier Stesichorus:47

    Jest and song Apollo owns,
    Let Hades keep his woes and groans. 

Sophocles again,48 in his actual assignment of instruments to each, is quite clear, thus:

    Nor harp nor lyre to wailing strains is dear, 

for it was quite late, indeed only the other day, that the flute ventured to let itself speak "on themes of joy"; in early times it trailed along in mourning, nor was its service therein much esteemed or very cheerful; then there came a general confusion. It was specially by mingling things which were of Gods with those which were of dæmons that the distinction of the instruments was lost. Anyhow, the phrase "KNOW THYSELF" seems to stand in a sort of antithesis to the letter "E", and yet, again, to accord with it. The letter is an appeal, a cry raised in awe and worship to the God, as being throughout all eternity; the phrase is a reminder to mortal man of his own nature and of his weakness.'

NOTES

1. The Greek ΤΟΥ ΕΙ. This online edition is the translation of A.O. Prickard (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1918) with a few minor changes and some additional notes taken from the translation of C.W. King (London: George Bell and Sons, 1889). Local links of the form plutarchE.html#394a, #394b, etc., will take you (approximately) to the standard divisions of the work (which covers 384D to 394C).

2. There are ancient coins showing an "E" — not the "EI" of Plutarch — floating near the temple; King mentions amulets, below, note 6; his edition includes the woodcut of a Roman-era amulet reproduced below.

3. Fr. 960.

4. Serapion lived at Athens, as can be gathered from the essay "On the Pythian Responses".

5. This is Prickard's quirky translation; usually "incense".

6. King notes "This explanation, as all the rest, is founded on nothing but fancy, as a single consideration proves. The symbol, which is preserved to us by amulets, was indeed similar in shape to the lunar ϵ but then that character was unknown before Imperial times. In all probability it was an Indian cast mark; and imported like the Swastika or Fylfot, and many other Indian symbols, in prehistoric times."

E amulet

7. Prickard notes "i.e., at draughts, with a play on words". ἐκ πίνακος καῖ πυλαίας = "pernicious nonsense", another joke.

8. That is, εἴ, "if" or "whether", the standard opening to questions asked of the oracle.

9. That is, would send them about their business.

10. Fr. 71.

11. εἴ. "Dragged in", as an expletive or strengthener of the "if" (cf. the English "If then" and "If indeed", as forms rather than in meaning).

12. Ἄμα τέκνων ϑῆν δυσμένεα.

13. Il. 17, 29. ὥς ϑῆν καῖ ἔγω σόν λύσω μένος ἔι κέ μεν ἄντα
                             οτήῃς· 

14. Cf. Pseudodoxia IV.v and note.

15. Il. 1, 70.

16. So Emperius, whose reading is that of the Paris MS. E. (See Paton in loco.) King: 'In his fight with the Centaurs, regarded as sophists. Here is the common play upon the various senses of λόγος, impossible to be translated.'

17. To count by fives, anyway. King: ' πεμπάζειν, literally "to five fold" or "to quintuple". In early Greek numeration, the numbers up to 5 were denoted by as many vertical strokes; 5 by π; to which again were subjoined the proper amount [sic] of verticals up to 10, expressed by Δ.'

18. This or the contrary is of course true of all (whole) numbers: adding an even number to any even number gives even, to an odd gives odd; adding an odd number to an even gives an odd, to an odd gives an even.

19. That is, any odd number added to any even number gives an odd number.

20. A reference to the complaint with which the first attempts of Aeschylus and others to give literary form to the popular hymns in honour of Dionysus were greeted.

21. Another of Prickard's quirks; he notes "not many" to "Apollo". King: "on account of the reduction to one state", and he notes "As if derived from α privative, and πολλοι, and signifying "Destroyer of plurality" [or "Absence of plurality"] — the most preposterous of all the absurd derivations recorded by our Author".

22. Fr. 392.

23. Or as we should say, "creation" and "conflagration", but Prickard is making a distinction between a one-time affair and a recurring one. The creation takes three times as long as the conflagration. Prickard: "Terms used by Heraclitus (Fr. 24), adapted by the Stoics for the periodic conflagration and renewal of the universe."

24. Timæus, 31A [Plato Timaeus 31a] and 55E foll. [Plato Timaeus 55e]

25. Aristotle De Cælo, 1, 8-9, 276 a 18.

26. "Quintessence". King notes "πεμπτῆ οὐσία, which, from the property here mentioned, Julian calls τὸ εἰλικτῶν σῶμα, and says is symbolized by Atys."

27. Homer Iliad 15.190.

28. See. Iph. Aul. Euripides 865 and Herc. Fur. 1221.

29. The Pythagoreans.

30. Plato Cratylus 409a

31. Plato Sophist 254 - 256.

32. Plato Philebus 23c and following; Plato Philebus 66c.

33. King translates "the first casting of the three lots takes place — you throw neither three nor two — is it not so?" and notes "This passage is hopelessly corrupt. Perhaps the meaning is that the dice so used wanted the deuce and tierce pips."

34. Plutarch later did become a priest at Delphi.

35. From Simonides, a favourite phrase with Plutarch. = "long tradition"

36. King: "Equivalent in sense to the Hebrew 'Jehovah', and the ὁ ζῶν ϑεος of the Athenians."

37. Fr. 41.

38. Fr. 25.

39. Prickard: "See on this remarkable passage E. Norden, Agnostos Theos, p. 231 f., and the views of H. Diels, communicated to him. I have followed Norden in reading εἶ, ἤ (he suggests with hesitation προσεπιθειάζειν) (and so Paton and Diels). Diels thinks that οἱ παλαιοί may cover later philosophers such as Xenophanes."

40. On Apollo, see note 21 above. Ἴητος, "Archer", as though derived from the archaic ἵος = εἵς.

41. Homer Iliad 4.141

42. Homer Iliad 15.362

43. Pindar.

44. Homer Iliad 9.158

45. Fr. 149.

46. Euripides Suppliants 975.

47. Fr. 50.

48. Fr. 728, probably from the Thamyras.

****** Passage related to 5 as marriage of male and female

https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0244%3Asection%3D8

Section 8.

#+begin_quote
I answered therefore that Eustrophus has excellently solved the difficulty by number. For (said I) since all number is distributed into even and odd, unity is in efficacy common to them both,—for that being added to an even number, it makes it odd, and to an odd, it makes it even, two constituting the beginning of the even, and three of the odd. Now the number of five, composed of these two, is deservedly honored, as being the first compound made of the first simple numbers, and is called the marriage, for the resemblance of the odd with the male, and the even with the female. For in the divisions of the numbers into equal parts, the even, being wholly separated, leaves a certain capacious beginning and space in itself; but in the odd, suffering the same thing, there always remains a middle, of generative distribution, by which it is more fruitful than the other, and being mixed is always master, never mastered. For by the mixture of both, even and odd together, there is never produced an even number but always an odd. But which is more, either of them added to and compounded with itself shows the difference; for no even joined with another even ever produced an odd, or went forth of its proper nature, being through weakness unable to generate another and imperfect. But odd numbers mixed with odd do, through their being every way fruitful, produce many even ones. Time does not now permit us to set down the other powers and differences of numbers. Therefore have the Pythagoreans, through a certain resemblance, said that five is the marriage of the first male and the first female number. This [p. 486] also is it for which it is called Nature, by the multiplication of itself determining again into itself. For as Nature, taking a grain of wheat for seed and diffusing it, produces many forms and species between, by which she brings her work to an end, but at last she shows again a grain of wheat, restoring the beginning in the end of all; so, while the rest of the numbers, when they are multiplied into others, terminate by the increase only those of five and six, multiplied by themselves, bring back and preserve themselves. For six times six makes thirty-six, and five times five makes twenty-five. And again, six does this once, and only after one manner, to wit, when it is squared. But this indeed befalls five both by multiplication and by composition with itself, to which being added, it alternatively makes itself and ten; and this as far as all number can extend, this number imitating the beginning or first Cause which governs the universe. For as that first Cause, preserving the world by itself, does reciprocally perfect itself by the world, as Heraclitus says of fire,

    Fire turns to all things, and all things to fire;

and as money is changed for gold, and gold for money; so the congress of five with itself is framed by Nature to produce nothing imperfect or strange, but has limited changes; for it either generates itself or ten, that is, either what is proper to itself, or what is perfect.

Πρόσωπα
February 17 at 4:35 AM  ·
Γεννήθηκα και μεγάλωσα στον 
Πειραιά. Στην Καστέλλα. Το 1936. 
Πριν τελειώσω το Γυμνάσιο 
παντρεύτηκα και πήγα στη Ρώμη.
Στη Ρώμη με οδήγησε η ανάγκη μου
ως Έλληνα να καλύψω ένα κενό.
Το κενό της Αναγέννησης.
Η Ελλάδα δεν έζησε την Αναγέννηση.
Η Ελλάδα περνά από το Βυζάντιο
στο ''τίποτα''.
Δε θα ξεχάσω ποτέ 
αυτό που μου έδωσε η μεγάλη 
αναγεννησιακή ζωγραφική.
Ο Μαζάτσο και ο Καραβάτζο.
Δύο προσωπικότητες
που περικλείνουν 
μία σημαντική ιδεολογία
που δε σας κρύβω ότι
ερχόμενος σε επαφή μαζί τους,
ταράχτηκα. Ανησύχησα.
Πηγαίνοντας στη σχολή
διαπίστωσα ότι δεν υπάρχει
ένας δρόμος για τη γνώση.
Για να την κατακτήσουμε
δεν πρέπει να πηγαίνουμε
από τα ίδια μονοπάτια.
Στη ζωγραφική, 
για να καταλάβεις 
τη σημασία ενός έργου
πρέπει να το δεις 
κάτω από διαφορετικό 
φως κάθε φορά.
Το πρωί ένα κάδρο λέει κάτι
και το απόγευμα κάτι άλλο.
Τα κάδρα δεν είναι 
πάντοτε τα ίδια.
Εξαρτάται από το 
πώς τα βλέπεις κι εσύ. 
Μια ζωγραφική πάνω σ' ένα τοίχο, 
είναι διαφορετική 
από μια ζωγραφική σε μουσαμά.
Το ίδιο συμβαίνει και με τη ζωγραφική 
που τη βλέπεις μέσα στην εκκλησία 
την ώρα της λειτουργίας ή όχι.
Η τέχνη από τους 
καλλιτέχνες φτιάχνεται, 
χωρίς με αυτό να αρνούμαι 
την επίδραση του περιβάλλοντος
στον καλλιτέχνη και το έργο του.
Ο χώρος που εκτίθεται ένα έργο,
γενικότερα, είναι πολύ δεμένος
με τη σημασία του έργου.
Ο καλλιτέχνης είναι ένας 
άνθρωπος που σκέφτεται 
κι επειδή σκέφτεται, φτιάχνει.
Δεν κάνουν όλα τα υλικά 
σ' έναν καλλιτέχνη. Γι' αυτό 
χρησιμοποιεί αυτό το υλικό 
και όχι ένα άλλο.
Η επιλογή των υλικών
δίνει ξεχωριστή υπόσταση
στον καλλιτέχνη.
Το κάρβουνο και το σίδερο 
έχουν ένα μακρύ παρελθόν, 
που εγώ, χρησιμοποιώντας το 
σήμερα για να φτιάξω 
τη στρατηγική μου ιδέα για το μέλλον, 
εξασφαλίζω στο μέλλον ένα παρελθόν.
Ο Πωλ Κλέε έλεγε ότι το 70% 
ενός καλλιτέχνη είναι το ένστικτο.
Συμφωνώ. Ο καλλιτέχνης, 
τελικώς, πάει στα τυφλά.
Είναι ένας τυφλός 
που κάποια στιγμή 
είδε πολύ καθαρά και έντονα.
Θα έλεγα εκτυφλωτικά.
Αμέσως μετά τυφλώθηκε,
κουφάθηκε, βουβάθηκε, 
κι άρχισε μα δημιουργεί.
Γι' αυτό και δημιουργεί μ' ένα 
δικό του γλωσσικό κώδικα.
Γιατί δεν βλέπει πια. 
Σίγουρα όμως 
κάποτε είδε και φτιάχνει 
αυτό που είδε καθαρά.
Αν μετά τη λάμψη συνέχιζε
να βλέπει, ν' ακούει, να μιλάει,
θα ήταν ένας νατουραλιστής.
Εφόσον δεν είναι,
σημαίνει ότι δεν βλέπει
δεν ακούει, ούτε μιλάει πια.
Ζωγράφιζα από δεκατριών ετών.
Έδωσα εξετάσεις 
στη Σχολή Καλών Τεχνών
και απέτυχα.
Ήμουν και κακός μαθητής στο σχολείο...
Δεν ένιωσα ποτέ πίκρα για την Ελλάδα. 
Δεν επιτρέπω στον εαυτό μου 
να έχει αυτού του είδους τις πίκρες.
Κοίταζα να βρω αυτά που μου έλειπαν.
Δεν είχα άλλου είδους συναισθήματα.
Οι Έλληνες ανακάλυψαν την έννοια
της συμμετρίας και της αρμονίας.
Πώς είναι δυνατόν να αρκούνται
στη μικρότητα του συναισθηματισμού;
Δεν αναζήτησα παρά μόνο 
όμορφα πράγματα.
Μέτρησα την απόσταση 
μέσα από την 
αντικειμενικότητα.
Είδα το ιερό 
στα αντικείμενα 
καθημερινής χρήσης.
Πίστεψα στο βάρος ως σωστό μέτρο.
Διέσχισα μονοπάτια δύσκολα, 
μέσα στο δάσος,
ανηφορίζοντας προς το βουνό.
Το μολύβι, 
τα μαλλιά, τα σύννεφα, 
η Μικρή Άρκτος που δείχνει τον Βορρά, 
ο Άνεμος. 
Δεν ξέρω να ζω έξω από 
τον λαβύρινθο της γλώσσας.
Αγαπώ την ελιά, 
τ' αμπέλι και το στάρι.
Θέλω την επιστροφή 
της ποίησης με όλα τα μέσα:
με την άσκηση, 
την παρατήρηση, 
τη μοναξιά, τον λόγο, 
την εικόνα, την εξέγερση.
Ανικανοποίητος 
μέχρι το διηνεκές.
Γιάννης Κουνέλλης
Σαν σήμερα, το 2017, έφυγε από τη ζωή.

These Spatial AI-powered kits offer students and researchers alike to perform real-world projects instead of working on just the databases available and reporting a test accuracy on the test accuracy but never seeing it work in the real world. These cameras offer a pathway to test models in production environments without needing any other external hardware.

So, in conclusion, I feel if one is an aspiring computer vision student, it is certainly worth it. A lot of development is going to happen on it and it might just do that for computer vision what Raspberry Pi did for hobbyist hardware.

*** Discussion on Condition:
**** Josh

Josh-Iannis: Discuss the example by James Harkins scheduling multiple unix commands and waiting for all of them to finish asynchronously before proceeding.  It would be great to be able to do this outside a thread (Iannis).  Josh suggests that one may be able to use an object or method like "dispatch" that does that job by counting which jobs/conditions/actions have finished and proceeds when all of them are done. (all of this to be done in sclang.)

Josh asks: What happens if a command has returned an error. ? (note: Iannis: also if it does not return? Should there still be individual timeouts for each of the waiting jobs/conditions?).

Josh suggests: See what is happening in the ios dev group:

Patrick suggests: There is a group on rust dev group looking into sc. Interesting to know! https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2021/03/10/this-week-in-rust-381/ (?)

Η Βάσω Κιντή γεννήθηκε το 1957 στη Θεσσαλονίκη. Σπούδασε Χημεία στο Πανεπιστήμιο Αθηνών και Φιλοσοφία και Ιστορία της Επιστήμης στο ΕΜΠ. Σήμερα είναι καθηγήτρια Φιλοσοφίας στο Τμήμα Ιστορίας και Φιλοσοφίας της Επιστήμης του Πανεπιστημίου Αθηνών. 

 

Συμμετείχε στην ίδρυση και ήταν υπεύθυνη σύνταξης του φιλοσοφικού περιοδικού «Cogito». Είναι μέλος του Εθνικού Συμβουλίου Έρευνας, Τεχνολογίας και Καινοτομίας Αθηνών, ιδρυτικό μέλος του Δ.Σ. της Ελληνικής Εταιρείας Γυναικών Πανεπιστημιακών και έχει διατελέσει μέλος του Συμβουλίου Ιδρύματος του Πανεπιστημίου Aθηνών. Πολύ συχνά αρθρογραφεί για θέματα φιλοσοφίας του δημόσιου χώρου και ακαδημαϊκής πολιτικής.

 

Το επόμενο χρονικό διάστημα θα εκδοθεί από τις εκδόσεις Πόλις το νέο της βιβλίο «Φιλοσοφία της Ιστορίας». Με αυτή την αφορμή τη συναντώ ένα ηλιόλουστο πρωινό στο σπίτι της στην Αγία Παρασκευή.

 

Στη συζήτησή μας επισημαίνει σχετικά με το περιεχόμενο του βιβλίου: «H Ιστορία, είτε ως γεγονότα που συνέβησαν στο παρελθόν είτε ως ιστοριογραφία, μας ενδιαφέρει, μας γοητεύει, μας απασχολεί και μας διχάζει. Συζητάμε για ιστορικά γεγονότα του παρελθόντος, διαφωνούμε για την ερμηνεία τους, αναρωτιόμαστε αν υπάρχει αλήθεια στην Ιστορία. Η Φιλοσοφία της Ιστορίας, που είναι το αντικείμενο του παρόντος βιβλίου, μελετά τα θέματα αυτά με γενικό τρόπο, παίρνοντας απόσταση από συγκεκριμένες αντιδικίες. Εξετάζει τι είναι το παρελθόν και τι το ιστορικό παρελθόν, τι είναι τα γεγονότα και τι τα συμβάντα, τι είναι τα τεκμήρια».

 

    Aν θέλεις να ανατρέψεις το σύστημα για να κάνεις επανάσταση, πρέπει να μας πεις τι επιθυμείς για να το αντικαταστήσεις. Οι παλιές ουτοπίες έχουν γεράσει και έχουν δείξει τις σκουριές και τα αδιέξοδα στα οποία οδηγούν. 

 

Στη συνέντευξη που ακολουθεί μιλά για όλα τα θέματα της επικαιρότητας, την τριτοβάθμια εκπαίδευση, τις προκλήσεις της εποχής μας, τα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης αλλά και τη Φιλοσοφία.  

 

— Ποια πιστεύετε ότι είναι η μεγάλη πρόκληση της εποχής μας και γιατί; 

Δεν πιστεύω ότι είναι μία. Είναι πολλές, τόσο σε παγκόσμιο επίπεδο, όπως η κλιματική αλλαγή, οι νέες γεωπολιτικές ισορροπίες, η τρομοκρατία και οι ψηφιακές εξελίξεις, όσο και σε εθνικό, όπως η βελτίωση της οικονομικής κατάστασης της χώρας και των πολιτών, η επί της ουσίας βελτίωση της παιδείας, η ενίσχυση της ισότητας σε ό,τι αφορά την πρόσβαση σε αγαθά, η καταπολέμηση των πελατειακών σχέσεων και ένας καλύτερα ενημερωμένος δημόσιος χώρος.

 

Πάντοτε οι προκλήσεις είναι σε πολλά μέτωπα και, σε μια προηγμένη δημοκρατία, υπάρχουν πάντοτε οι άνθρωποι με ειδικά ενδιαφέροντα και ειδικές γνώσεις που εστιάζουν την προσοχή μας σε αυτά. Πρέπει να κάνουμε πολλά ταυτόχρονα. Μετά, πρέπει να έχουμε εκείνον τον δημόσιο χώρο που θα επιτρέπει τον διάλογο και τη σοβαρή ενημέρωση για να μπορούμε να κρίνουμε και να αναλαμβάνουμε δράση, είτε ως κράτος είτε ως άτομα.

 

Αν μπορούσα να απομονώσω κάποια πρόκληση που σχετίζεται με αυτό που κάνω, θα έλεγα ότι μεγάλη πρόκληση αποτελεί η κατανόηση της επιστήμης, που ως πρακτική μεταβάλλεται σημαντικά αυτή την εποχή, και του ρόλου της στις σύγχρονες κοινωνίες, που είναι πολυσχιδής και διαρκώς διευρύνεται. Το θέμα αυτό συνδέεται με την εμπιστοσύνη ή τη δυσπιστία απέναντι στους ειδικούς και συνεπώς με το πρόβλημα του λαϊκισμού. Συνδέεται επίσης με την ανάγκη να διακρίνουμε μεταξύ εγκυρότητας και αλήθειας από τη μια μεριά, και λάθους, παραπλάνησης ή και αγυρτείας από την άλλη.

 

— Πώς ορίζετε τον συνειδητό πολίτη; Είδαμε τελευταία ένα μεγάλο μέρος της κοινωνίας να μην ασπάζεται την έννοια της ατομικής ευθύνης. 

Συνειδητός πολίτης, κατά τη γνώμη μου, είναι ο ενημερωμένος πολίτης, αυτός που θεωρεί ότι καθετί στην κοινότητα τον αφορά, όχι κατ’ ανάγκην για να δράσει αλλά για να μπορεί να διαμορφώνει την κρίση του. Τον χαρακτηρίζουμε συνειδητό, διότι θέλουμε να τονίσουμε ότι δεν δρα παρορμητικά αλλά έχει σκεφτεί, έχει ζυγίσει θέσεις και επιχειρήματα, έχει συνείδηση του τι κάνει. Αναλαμβάνει την ευθύνη των λεγομένων και των πράξεών του.

 

Η έννοια της ατομικής ευθύνης που υπονοείτε είναι μάλλον η ευθύνη που αναλαμβάνει ο καθένας μας ατομικά απέναντι στους άλλους, στην κοινότητα και απέναντι στο δέον γενικά, θα έλεγα. Ποια είναι η ευθύνη μου, τι πρέπει να πράξω εγώ ώστε να κάνω το σωστό; Είναι αλήθεια ότι πολλοί σκέφτονται κοντόφθαλμα, εγωιστικά, ιδιοτελώς.

 

Όμως είναι σημαντικό αυτό που μας λέει ο Καντ: για κάθε πράξη μας να σκεφτόμαστε αν θα θέλαμε να την κάνουν όλοι. Όταν δεν πληρώνουμε φόρους, να θέλουμε να μην πληρώνει κανένας, όταν κατεβαίνουμε σε διαδηλώσεις εν μέσω πανδημίας, να θέλουμε όλοι να κατεβαίνουν, αψηφώντας τα μέτρα. Πρέπει, μας λέει, καθένας από μας να σκέφτεται πως είναι ένας καθολικός νομοθέτης που επιβάλλει κανόνες σε όλους, αλλά στους οποίους υπόκειται και ο ίδιος.

— Τι μας έμαθε η συνθήκη της απομόνωσης και του εγκλεισμού; 

Ελπίζω ότι μας έμαθε να εκτιμάμε τα βασικά. Μας επέτρεψε, επίσης, να αναστοχαστούμε την ανθρώπινη συνθήκη: πόσο αβέβαια και εύθραυστα είναι όλα, πόσο λίγα μπορούμε να ελέγξουμε, πόσο πολύτιμη και αναγκαία είναι η κανονικότητα που συνήθως περιφρονούμε. Πιο πρακτικά, μας έμαθε πόσο σημαντικό είναι να θωρακιζόμαστε απέναντι σε απροσδόκητες καταστάσεις (π.χ. να έχουμε καλό σύστημα υγείας, να επενδύουμε στην έρευνα) και μας έδωσε τη δυνατότητα μαζικά και σε σύντομο διάστημα να αποκτήσουμε νέες δεξιότητες.

 

Βέβαια, πάρα πολλοί άνθρωποι, είτε διότι αρρώστησαν, είτε διότι έχασαν τη δουλειά τους, είτε διότι η δουλειά τους εντατικοποιήθηκε σε υπέρμετρο βαθμό, δεν έχουν την πολυτέλεια να αναστοχάζονται όταν πρέπει να κινητοποιηθούν για τα στοιχειώδη. Αλλά όλων η εμπειρία πρέπει να ληφθεί υπ’ όψιν για την επόμενη μέρα. Τέλος, θα έλεγα πως, παρότι κλεισμένοι μέσα, μάθαμε να απλώνουμε το βλέμμα μας σε όλη τη γη, πέρα από τα εθνικά μας σύνορα. Παρακολουθούμε και συγκρίνουμε τι συμβαίνει σε κάθε γωνιά του πλανήτη, μας διασκεδάζουν και μας συγκινούν πρωτοβουλίες και χειρονομίες από ανθρώπους μακρινούς και άγνωστους, που δείχνουν πόσο διαφορετικοί είμαστε, αλλά συγχρόνως πόσο όμοιοι.

— Μπορεί ο αντισυστημικός λαϊκισμός να γίνει μια σημαντική απειλή για τις κοινωνίες μας; 

Θα πω πώς το σκέφτομαι ως πολίτης, γιατί δεν είμαι ειδικός. Ο ίδιος ο όρος «αντισυστημικός λαϊκισμός» παραπέμπει σε ένα ανησυχητικό φαινόμενο, όταν το σύστημα στο οποίο παροτρύνεται ο λαός να εναντιωθεί είναι το δημοκρατικό καθεστώς με τα προβλήματα και τις αδυναμίες του. Άλλο να κάνεις κριτική για να τα λύσεις και να τα εξαλείψεις κι άλλο να επιτίθεσαι σε κρίσιμους πυλώνες και αρμούς για να το απορρίψεις συλλήβδην. Κι αν θέλεις να ανατρέψεις το σύστημα για να κάνεις επανάσταση, πρέπει να μας πεις τι επιθυμείς για να το αντικαταστήσεις.

 

Οι παλιές ουτοπίες έχουν γεράσει και έχουν δείξει τις σκουριές και τα αδιέξοδα στα οποία οδηγούν. Τα φαινόμενα του αντισυστημικού λαϊκισμού που παρατηρήσαμε τα τελευταία χρόνια μοιάζουν με αντίστοιχα φαινόμενα στο παρελθόν και δεν είναι παρά η χειραγώγηση ανθρώπων από αδίστακτους ηγετίσκους που εκμεταλλεύονται φοβίες και ελπίδες για πολύ ταπεινούς, με την κακή έννοια, σκοπούς.

 

— Σας ανησυχούν η δημαγωγία και ο ανορθολογισμός που βρίσκουν εύφορο έδαφος στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης;

Με φοβίζει ο μηχανικός τρόπος μαζικής διάδοσης. Σαν να διαδίδεται αστραπιαία φωτιά στα σπαρτά. Η ταχύτητα και η μαζικότητα εξαφανίζουν τη σκέψη. Οι άνθρωποι αντιδρούν, δεν σκέφτονται, και γίνονται υποχείριο, όπως ήδη έχουμε δει να συμβαίνει, είτε δημαγωγών όπως ο Tραμπ είτε κακόβουλων οργανισμών και ομάδων που προσπαθούν να επηρεάσουν εκλογικά αποτελέσματα και κοινωνικές συμπεριφορές. Από την άλλη, δεν υπάρχει μόνο ανορθολογισμός. Υπάρχει και συγκροτημένη σκέψη και έλλογος διάλογος. Μόνο που πνίγεται και κινδυνεύει από τον μεγάλο θόρυβο. Πάντως, είμαστε ακόμη στην αρχή αυτού του τρόπου επικοινωνίας και τα πράγματα θα εξελιχθούν. 

 

    Ο ΣΥΡΙΖΑ εξαπάτησε τους πολίτες συνειδητά για να πάρει την ψήφο τους (δεν ήταν τόσο αφελείς για να έχουν αυταπάτες) και κυβέρνησε με ανευθυνότητα, βάζοντας τη χώρα σε κίνδυνο, όπως με το δημοψήφισμα, και περιφρόνηση απέναντι στους θεσμούς, όπως με τις τηλεοπτικές άδειες, τη Δικαιοσύνη. Καλλιέργησε τη χυδαιότητα στην πολιτική ζωή. 

 

— Έχουν νόημα οι ιδεολογίες σήμερα; 

Κατά τη γνώμη μου, πάντα έχουν νόημα. Η ιδεολογία είναι αναπόδραστη και την αναδέχεται κανείς, χωρίς πάντα να το καταλαβαίνει. Σχηματίζοντας μια εικόνα για τον κόσμο, χρησιμοποιώντας έννοιες, σχήματα, παραστάσεις κ.λπ., παραλαμβάνεις και αποκτάς μια ιδεολογική σκευή. Οπότε καλύτερα να την αναγνωρίζεις παρά να την ξορκίζεις, ώστε να την εξετάσεις και να την ελέγξεις, να τη συγκρίνεις και να την εκλεπτύνεις.

 

Ίσως, βέβαια, η ερώτηση να είναι πιο συγκεκριμένη: να εννοεί αν έχουν ξεπεραστεί συγκεκριμένες ιδεολογίες, όπως η μαρξιστική, ή η συντηρητική, ή η φιλελεύθερη, ή η ιδεολογία του δεξιού ή του αριστερού. Υπ’ αυτή την έννοια, θα λέγαμε ότι κάποιες ιδεολογίες, η μαρξιστική για παράδειγμα, είναι πιο περιθωριοποιημένες σήμερα σε σχέση με το παρελθόν, κυρίως λόγω όσων συνέβησαν το 1989 και όσων έρχονται στο φως έκτοτε.

— Πώς αποτιμάτε την «πρώτη φορά αριστερά»; Πώς βλέπετε σήμερα την κυβέρνηση του Κυριάκου Μητσοτάκη;  

Παίρνω τον όρο «πρώτη φορά αριστερά» ως κύριο όνομα που δηλώνει μια συγκεκριμένη οντότητα, την κυβέρνηση ΣΥΡΙΖΑ την περίοδο 2015-2019. Δεν θα συζητήσω αν ο φορέας αυτός με συμπεριφορά γκρουπούσκουλου είναι όντως αριστερά, τι είναι η αριστερά κ.λπ. Θα δεχτώ τον τίτλο που αυτοί επέλεξαν.

 

Λοιπόν, πρώτον, δεν ήταν κυβέρνηση της αριστεράς. Ήταν κυβέρνηση αριστεράς και ασόβαρης, λούμπεν, αντιδραστικής ακροδεξιάς. Δηλαδή, κυριολεκτικά ένα τέρας. Η συμμαχία αυτή δεν στηριζόταν σε μια συμφωνία θέσεων αλλά σε μια συμφωνία για να καταλάβουν την εξουσία. Οι θέσεις και οι απόψεις δεν είχαν καμία σημασία, γι’ αυτό και αγνοήθηκαν. Ξεκίνησαν με, υποτίθεται, αντιμνημονιακή σύμπνοια και έγιναν οι πιο φρόνιμοι μνημονιακοί.

 

Ο ΣΥΡΙΖΑ εξαπάτησε τους πολίτες συνειδητά για να πάρει την ψήφο τους (δεν ήταν τόσο αφελείς για να έχουν αυταπάτες) και κυβέρνησε με ανευθυνότητα, βάζοντας τη χώρα σε κίνδυνο, όπως με το δημοψήφισμα, και περιφρόνηση απέναντι στους θεσμούς, όπως με τις τηλεοπτικές άδειες, τη Δικαιοσύνη. Καλλιέργησε τη χυδαιότητα στην πολιτική ζωή. Τι να πρωτοθυμηθούμε; Ας πούμε το «Ιδού η Ρόδος. Και το πήδημα σε λίγες μέρες, με την ώθηση του λαού μας» του Τσίπρα. Μια σκοτεινή περίοδος.

 

Η κυβέρνηση Μητσοτάκη είναι μια κανονική κυβέρνηση ‒κι αυτό είναι ανακουφιστικό σε σχέση με το roller-coaster της κυβέρνησης Τσίπρα‒, παρότι της έτυχε η απροσδόκητη συνθήκη της πανδημίας που συγκλόνισε όλη την υφήλιο. Την αντιμετωπίζει με ψυχραιμία, μεθοδικότητα και σοβαρότητα, πράγμα που έχει αποτελέσματα και αναγνωρίζεται ευρέως. Μέσα στη δυστοπία του εγκλεισμού και των θανάτων, μας έδωσε τη δυνατότητα να αισθανθούμε κάπως περήφανοι για τη χώρα μας.

 

Γενικά, θα έλεγα πως διαθέτει εμπειρία και έχει ένα σχέδιο αλλαγών για την αντιμετώπιση προβλημάτων του παρελθόντος και των προκλήσεων του μέλλοντος. Αυτό είναι καθησυχαστικό. Όπως καθησυχαστικό είναι ότι ο πρωθυπουργός έχει την ικανότητα να συνομιλεί με επάρκεια με ειδικούς και διεθνείς παράγοντες, ώστε να ενημερώνεται με εγκυρότητα και να έχει την εποπτεία που απαιτείται. Έχεις την αίσθηση ότι η χώρα κυβερνάται, πριν, επί ΣΥΡΙΖΑ, αισθανόσουν ότι παράδερνε.

 

Βεβαίως, είναι μια κυβέρνηση της κεντροδεξιάς, της συντηρητικής παράταξης, δεν ανήκω ιδεολογικά σε αυτόν τον χώρο, αλλά μετά από όλη αυτή την ταλαιπωρία, παρά τις επιμέρους διαφωνίες, στηρίζω τις πολιτικές που θεωρώ κρίσιμες και χρήσιμες για τη χώρα.

Στα ελληνικά πανεπιστήμια υπάρχει λιγότερη ελευθερία απ’ όση υπάρχει έξω αυτά. Δεν μπορούν να ακουστούν όλες οι απόψεις γιατί κάποιοι τα θεωρούν άσυλο της τυραννίας τους. Σοβαροί ακαδημαϊκοί, φοιτητές και πρυτάνεις είναι στο έλεος ταγμάτων εφόδου, χωρίς καμία προστασία. Φωτ.: Πάρις Ταβιτιάν/LIFO

 

— Έχετε υποστηρίξει ότι «τα πανεπιστήμια γίνονται πάρκινγκ ανθρώπων για τους οποίους δεν ενδιαφέρεται κανείς». Ποια είναι τα προβλήματα της τριτοβάθμιας εκπαίδευσης και με ποιους τρόπους μπορούν να επιλυθούν;

Αναφερόμουν ειδικά στους λεγόμενους «αιώνιους φοιτητές», που πολλοί, δήθεν από ενδιαφέρον και συμπόνια, τους εγκαταλείπουν στην τύχη τους. Δηλαδή λένε «μη βάζετε όρια στη φοίτηση, μην ασχολείστε μ’ αυτούς, αφήστε τους φοιτητές να μην παρακολουθούν, να εξετάζονται όποτε θέλουν, όσες φορές θέλουν, επ’ άπειρον. Είναι εκτός εκπαιδευτικής διαδικασίας» ‒ το είπε τόσο ωμά ο Αλέξης Τσίπρας στη Βουλή.

 

Δεν δείχνει αυτή η στάση περιφρόνηση και πλήρη αδιαφορία γι’ αυτούς τους ανθρώπους; Το να θέτεις όρια στη φοίτηση σημαίνει ότι το ίδιο το ίδρυμα πρέπει να βρει τρόπους οι φοιτητές του να τελειώνουν κατά το δυνατόν στην ώρα τους (εξαιρουμένων αυτών που αναγκάζονται να δουλεύουν και όσων αντιμετωπίζουν προβλήματα υγείας). Πρέπει, δηλαδή, να φροντίσει να φέρει σε πέρας αυτό που έχει αναλάβει: να μορφώσει τους φοιτητές και να πιστοποιήσει τις γνώσεις τους. Δεν μπορεί να είναι το πανεπιστήμιο ένα κουφάρι που στεγάζει αδρανείς «φοιτητές» που δεν παρακολουθούν, εξετάζονται όποτε να ’ναι και περνάνε μαθήματα ανάλογα με τις διαθέσεις του καθηγητή.

 

Το πρόβλημα των αιώνιων φοιτητών είναι μία από τις εκφάνσεις των παθογενειών του ελληνικού πανεπιστημίου. Υπάρχουν πολλές. Αλλά δεν χρειάζεται να ανακαλύψουμε τον τροχό. Υπάρχουν πολλά σπουδαία πανεπιστήμια στον κόσμο, από τα οποία μπορούμε να μάθουμε, χωρίς να αντιγράψουμε πιστά ένα μοντέλο. Χρειάζεται σοβαρή διοίκηση, αξιολόγηση, λογοδοσία και εστίαση στο τι χρειάζονται οι φοιτητές και αναμένει η χώρα. Δηλαδή σοβαρή μόρφωση και έρευνα. Καθ’ υπερβολήν θα πω ότι εδώ και χρόνια τα πανεπιστήμια δεν υπάρχουν για τους φοιτητές και τη χώρα αλλά για τους καθηγητές, οι οποίοι δεν λογοδοτούν πουθενά, και για όσους τα νέμονται.

 

— Έχει αποδώσει η κατάργηση του ασύλου; 

Πρώτα απ’ όλα, να πούμε ότι έχει γίνει μια αντιστροφή όρων: δεν καταργήθηκε το άσυλο με τους νόμους Διαμαντοπούλου και Κεραμέως. Επιχειρήθηκε να καταργηθεί το άσυλο ανομίας. Αυτό ακόμα δεν έχει επιτευχθεί. Γιατί; Διότι υπάρχουν ταμπού, πολιτικό κόστος και ανελευθερία μέσα στα πανεπιστήμια. Το παραδέχτηκε, επιτέλους, και ο αρχηγός της αξιωματικής αντιπολίτευσης, ενάντια στις θέσεις στελεχών του κόμματός του: στα ελληνικά πανεπιστήμια υπάρχει λιγότερη ελευθερία απ’ όση υπάρχει έξω αυτά. Δεν μπορούν να ακουστούν όλες οι απόψεις γιατί κάποιοι τα θεωρούν άσυλο της τυραννίας τους. Σοβαροί ακαδημαϊκοί, φοιτητές και πρυτάνεις είναι στο έλεος ταγμάτων εφόδου, χωρίς καμία προστασία. Ελπίζουμε αυτό να αλλάξει με τη νέα νομοθεσία.

 

    Δεν μπορεί να είναι το πανεπιστήμιο ένα κουφάρι που στεγάζει αδρανείς «φοιτητές» που δεν παρακολουθούν, εξετάζονται όποτε να ’ναι και περνάνε μαθήματα ανάλογα με τις διαθέσεις του καθηγητή. Το πρόβλημα των αιώνιων φοιτητών είναι μία από τις εκφάνσεις των παθογενειών του ελληνικού πανεπιστημίου. Υπάρχουν πολλές. Αλλά δεν χρειάζεται να ανακαλύψουμε τον τροχό. 

 

— Αν σας ζητούσα να μου πείτε ποια είναι η χειρότερη παθογένεια στον χώρο της εκπαίδευσης τι θα μου απαντούσατε;

Ότι ως κοινωνία δεν δίνουμε σημασία στο περιεχόμενο και στην ίδια τη διαδικασία της εκπαίδευσης αλλά εστιάζουμε στους τίτλους σπουδών και γενικά στη συγκέντρωση πιστοποιήσεων για προσόντα που εμφανίζονται στα χαρτιά. Αυτό ισχύει τόσο για τη δευτεροβάθμια όσο και για την τριτοβάθμια εκπαίδευση. Συγκεντρώνουμε βαθμούς, διπλώματα και πτυχία, πολλά διεκπεραιωτικά μεταπτυχιακά, που δεν ξέρουμε τι πραγματικό αντίκρισμα έχουν.

 

Τα προγράμματα σπουδών συχνά δεν συγκροτούνται με βάση τις απαιτήσεις του αντικειμένου και του επαγγέλματος αλλά με βάση τις ειδικότητες των καθηγητών, την ισχύ και τις υποχρεώσεις που έχουν. Οι ίδιοι οι φοιτητές δεν καταλαβαίνουν ποια πράγματα γίνονται εις βάρος τους. Ενώ έχουν το δικαίωμα από τον νόμο, δεν εκλέγουν αντιπροσώπους για να μετέχουν στα πανεπιστημιακά όργανα, ώστε να παρακολουθούν και να έχουν λόγο για τις αποφάσεις που τους αφορούν.

 

Θα σας πω ένα ενδεικτικό παράδειγμα γι’ αυτή την εστίαση στα χαρτιά έναντι της ουσίας. Πολλοί φοιτητές και εκπαιδευτικοί παρακολουθούν διαλέξεις, συνέδρια και σεμινάρια, συνήθως όχι για να μάθουν, να μορφωθούν, αλλά για να πάρουν βεβαίωση παρακολούθησης. Τέτοιες βεβαιώσεις έχουν μηδαμινή αξία και όσοι τυχόν τις ζητούν δεν ενδιαφέρονται ούτε αυτοί για την ουσία, αλλά μόνο για τους τύπους, το χαρτί. Μετέχουν τόσο οι μεν όσο και οι δε σε μια προσομοίωση εκπαίδευσης και γνώσης.

 

Επίσης, τους ενδιαφέρουν μόνο οι εξετάσεις, πολλές φορές δεν γνωρίζουν τους καθηγητές τους ούτε ως πρόσωπα, δεν μας έχουν δει ποτέ, τα κυλικεία μοιάζουν με τα ΚΤΕΛ και στις εξεταστικές παίρνουν κακές σημειώσεις που τους δίνουν άνθρωποι των παρατάξεων. Αυτά που συμβαίνουν στο ελληνικό πανεπιστήμιο δεν τα συναντάς πουθενά διεθνώς. Συγχρόνως, επικρατεί φόβος στο διδακτικό προσωπικό για το τι μπορεί να τους συμβεί. Την ίδια στιγμή, πολλοί έχουν την αντίληψη ότι το πανεπιστήμιο τούς ανήκει, με αποτέλεσμα εδώ και πολλά χρόνια να κυριαρχεί ένας μιθριδατισμός. Τα πανεπιστήμια στην Ελλάδα είναι σαν ανεξάρτητα κράτη.

— Σε μια ιδιαίτερα ανταγωνιστική εποχή, όπως η σημερινή, ποια συμβουλή θα δίνατε σε έναν νέο φοιτητή; Ποια εικόνα εισπράττετε από την επαφή σας με τους φοιτητές; 

Η συμβουλή μου είναι πάντα η ίδια, ανεξάρτητα από το πόσο ανταγωνιστική είναι η εποχή, και τη λέω πάντα στους πρωτοετείς: είναι η μοναδική ευκαιρία στη ζωή σας να αφοσιωθείτε απερίσπαστοι και με ελευθερία στη μάθηση, να ανοίξετε τους ορίζοντές σας, να γνωρίσετε τόσα διαφορετικά πεδία και να τα εξερευνήσετε, να δοκιμάσετε νέες διαδρομές ζωής, να συνδεθείτε με την ιστορία της ανθρωπότητας.

 

Σε όλες τις άλλες περιόδους της ζωής σας έχετε ή κάποιον πάνω από το κεφάλι σας, τους γονείς, τους δασκάλους ή το αφεντικό σας, ή πολλές ευθύνες, σκοτούρες και υποχρεώσεις. Τώρα είναι η ευκαιρία να διερευνήσετε και να αναπτύξετε τις ικανότητές σας, να μορφωθείτε, να αποκτήσετε γνώσεις που δεν μπορεί ποτέ κανείς να σας στερήσει. Θα είναι πάντα δικές σας, να τις αναπτύξετε, να τις βελτιώσετε, να τις χρησιμοποιήσετε.

 

Δυστυχώς, η διδασκαλία στο ελληνικό πανεπιστήμιο δεν σου δίνει πάντα ικανοποίηση, κυρίως γιατί τα μαθήματα τα παρακολουθούν σχετικά λίγοι, ενώ αρκετοί απλώς μεταφέρουν στην αίθουσα το σώμα τους. Όμως πάντα θα υπάρχουν λίγα παιδιά που διψούν να μάθουν, που κάνουν ερωτήσεις, σχόλια, κριτική. Αυτά τα παιδιά σε κάνουν να προσπαθείς περισσότερο, να γίνεσαι καλύτερος, να ανανεώνεις και να βελτιώνεις το μάθημά σου για να ανταποκριθείς στις προσδοκίες τους, σε αυτό που αξίζουν να έχουν. Μου αρέσει να έχουν ανεξαρτησία πνεύματος, να μην προσκολλώνται και να μη μιμούνται τον καθηγητή.

 

Πέρυσι την άνοιξη, με την πανδημία, σε ένα μεταπτυχιακό μάθημα είχα μία από τις καλύτερες εμπειρίες διδασκαλίας. Όλοι, παρά τις δυσκολίες, κάναμε το καλύτερο που μπορούσαμε για να πετύχει η τηλεδιδασκαλία. Οι φοιτητές και οι φοιτήτριες είχαν συγκέντρωση, έδειξαν σοβαρότητα, υπευθυνότητα και ενδιαφέρον. Ήταν συγκινητικό.

 

Γενικά, πάντως, για το φοιτητικό σώμα θα έλεγα ότι, από την κρίση και μετά, απέκτησε μια ωριμότητα· επέστρεψε κάπως στα αμφιθέατρα, προσπαθεί πιο πολύ, αναλαμβάνει πιο πρωτότυπες ακαδημαϊκές πρωτοβουλίες. Υπάρχουν, βέβαια, πάντα και αυτοί που μένουν καθηλωμένοι σε παρωχημένα σχήματα και πρακτικές. Στενοχωριέμαι πολύ όταν σκέφτομαι πόσα στερούμε από τους φοιτητές μας που θα άνθιζαν, όσο δεν τους προσφέρουμε ένα ακαδημαϊκό περιβάλλον καθαρό, σταθερό, ασφαλές, ελεύθερο, στο οποίο να αναπτύσσουν τη δημιουργικότητά τους στην έρευνα, στην τέχνη, στις ιδέες, στον λόγο, μέσα και έξω από τα αμφιθέατρα. Γιατί να τα βλέπουμε αυτά στα πανεπιστήμια του εξωτερικού και όχι στης χώρας μας;

Φιλοσοφία δεν είναι ωραία λόγια, συχνά επιτηδευμένα ασαφή και βαθυστόχαστα, ούτε ελεύθερος συνειρμός. Ασφαλώς δεν καταφέρνω πάντα να σκέφτομαι αυστηρά, αλλά είναι ένα ιδεώδες που το προβάλλει και το καλλιεργεί το είδος της φιλοσοφίας που κάνω και μελετώ. Φωτ.: Πάρις Ταβιτιάν/LIFO

 

— Με την ευκαιρία της επετείου των 200 ετών από την Επανάσταση, έχουμε ανάγκη από εθνικό αναστοχασμό; Πώς κρίνετε τον σχεδιασμό των εορτασμών; 

Δεν τον έχω παρακολουθήσει. Φαντάζομαι ότι η πανδημία ακύρωσε πολλά σχέδια. Έτσι, στην αρχή του έτους τουλάχιστον ο εορτασμός θα γίνει μάλλον κατά μόνας. Οι επέτειοι και οι εορτασμοί πάντα σημαδεύουν τον χρόνο. Είναι μια προσωρινή στάση, ένα βήμα πίσω από την καθημερινότητα, για να κάνουμε μια αναδρομή και να αναστοχαστούμε. Να δούμε τι κάναμε, τι καταφέραμε, πού αποτύχαμε, ποιοι είμαστε, τι μας διαμόρφωσε, τι μας κάνει περήφανους, τι πρέπει να διορθώσουμε, τι μας λείπει και τι πρέπει να σχεδιάσουμε για το μέλλον. Τι να αξιοποιήσουμε και τι ν’ αφήσουμε πίσω. Όλα αυτά μπορούν να γίνουν ατομικά και συλλογικά, με επιστημονικές εκδόσεις και ημερίδες αλλά και με εθνικές γιορτές. Όλα είναι χρήσιμα και αναγκαία.

 
ευρασίαΟ Όττο Νόυρατ και η Ελλάδα
Ανταποκρίσεις για τα Βαλκάνια, τη Μακεδονία, τη Θεσσαλονίκη και την Ορθοδοξία, Επιμέλεια-Εισαγωγή: Βάσω Κιντή, εκδόσεις Ευρασία

— Πείτε μας λίγα λόγια για το νέο σας βιβλίο που θα κυκλοφορήσει από τις εκδόσεις Πόλις. 

Είναι ένα βιβλίο Φιλοσοφίας της Ιστορίας που θα κυκλοφορήσει την άνοιξη, εστιάζοντας στην ιστορία ως ιστοριογραφία, όχι ως γεγονότα του παρελθόντος. Συζητάω το θέμα της αντικειμενικότητας στην ιστορία, της αλήθειας, το εάν οι ιστορικοί δικαιούνται να εκφέρουν ηθικές κρίσεις, το κατά πόσο η Ιστορία είναι επιστήμη, πόσο χρήσιμη είναι, τι σκοπούς εξυπηρετεί, τι είναι τα ιστορικά γεγονότα σε σχέση με τα υπόλοιπα, τι είναι το παρελθόν και εάν μπορούμε να το διακρίνουμε από το παρόν και το μέλλον. Δηλαδή το βιβλίο ασχολείται με φιλοσοφικούς γρίφους, όπως το τελευταίο ερώτημα, αλλά και με θέματα που μας απασχολούν στην καθημερινότητά μας σε σχέση με την Ιστορία.

 

Πριν από δύο μήνες εκδόθηκε, από τις εκδόσεις Ευρασία αυτήν τη φορά, και ένα άλλο βιβλίο που επιμελήθηκα. Έχει τον τίτλο «Ο Όττο Νόυρατ και η Ελλάδα» και αφορά έναν αυστριακό φιλόσοφο, τον Ότο Nόιρατ, από τους πρωταγωνιστές του φιλοσοφικού ρεύματος του λογικού θετικισμού ή εμπειρισμού, που ήρθε στα Βαλκάνια στο 1912-13, κατά τη διάρκεια των Βαλκανικών Πολέμων (όπως και ο Τρότσκι), και έγραψε σύντομα κείμενα για τη Θεσσαλονίκη, την Ορθοδοξία, τα σύνορα στα Βαλκάνια, κάτι που είναι αναπάντεχα επίκαιρο αυτή την περίοδο σε σχέση με τη Βόρεια Μακεδονία. 

 

— Η κρίση θεωρείτε ότι μας άλλαξε προς το καλύτερο ή ο ατομικισμός μας είναι ακόμα ενεργός; 

Υπήρξαν και τα δύο. Μεγάλη γενναιοδωρία από τους γιατρούς και το νοσηλευτικό προσωπικό, τους ερευνητές, του εργαζόμενους στα σούπερ-μάρκετ, στην καθαριότητα, στα delivery, τους εθελοντές για τα εμβόλια, ακόμη και θυσία (σκέφτομαι τον γιατρό που ενημέρωσε για τον ιό στην Κίνα και πέθανε, τον ιερέα στην Ιταλία που παραχώρησε τη θέση του στην εντατική), και από την άλλη ιδιοτέλεια, με την παράκαμψη των μέτρων, που είναι επικίνδυνη τόσο για τους άλλους όσο και για τον ίδιο μας τον εαυτό.

 

Γενικά, πάντως, θα έλεγα ότι ως πολίτες επιδείξαμε υπευθυνότητα. Πολλοί στερηθήκαν πολλά (όπως οι μικροεπιχειρηματίες και οι εργαζόμενοι), υπέστησαν μεγάλες ζημιές για να προστατεύσουν άλλους. Ελπίζω αυτή η στάση να συνεχιστεί και να αποτελέσει πρότυπο. Όταν μας σέβεται η πολιτεία ως πολίτες (όπως φάνηκε με τον σχεδιασμό για τον εμβολιασμό), ανταποκρινόμαστε κι εμείς με υπευθυνότητα.

 

—Ποιο είναι εκείνο το χαρακτηριστικό της ελληνικής κοινωνίας που σας ενοχλεί; 

Με ενοχλεί η περιφρόνηση των νόμων και των κανόνων. Η διά της πλαγίας οδού απόπειρα να κερδίσουμε ένα πλεονέκτημα, δηλαδή η αδικία. Για το πρώτο θα σας πω μια εμπειρία. Έχω πάει σε αρκετές χώρες στον κόσμο, μερικές πολύ εντυπωσιακές από κάθε άποψη. Η μόνη φορά που ζήλεψα μια χώρα και στενοχωρήθηκα ήταν όταν επισκέφθηκα την περιοχή της Πούλιας στην Ιταλία, όπου η βλάστηση, το τοπίο και το κλίμα μοιάζουν πολύ με τα αντίστοιχα της νότιας Ελλάδας. Τα κτήματα, οι δρόμοι, τα χωριά, οι πλατείες, ήταν καθαρά και περιποιημένα, ο ρυθμός ζωής ανεπηρέαστος από τους επισκέπτες, η φυσιογνωμία του τοπίου και του τόπου διατηρημένη και προστατευμένη από την επέλαση τουριστών. Μεγάλη αντίθεση με την Ελλάδα, όπου ο καθένας βάζει μια οποιαδήποτε ταμπέλα στο μαγαζί του και στον δρόμο, παρατάει μπάζα στα κτήματα, χτίζει όπως να ’ναι και όπου να ’ναι, πουλάει οτιδήποτε, οπουδήποτε και οποιαδήποτε ώρα. Σαν να είμαστε παραδομένοι στους άλλους, σαν να μην έχουμε μια δική μας εσωτερική ζωή, έναν χαρακτήρα (λίγα χωριά το έχουν), σαν να έχουμε μια αγωνία να προλάβουμε, να τα καταφέρουμε.

 

Έχει, βέβαια, μια σβελτάδα αυτή η στάση τώρα που το σκέφτομαι, μια ικανότητα προσαρμογής και ανοικτότητας στην επικοινωνία. Αλλά η περιφρόνηση των νόμων είναι κάτι που με ενοχλεί και αποτελεί ένδειξη αντίστοιχης συμπεριφοράς και σε άλλα πράγματα.

 

— Ποιες θα είναι οι συνέπειες της ψηφιοποίησης στη ζωή μας;

Παρά τις ιερεμιάδες, η ψηφιοποίηση δεν κατέστρεψε τη γλώσσα, τον λόγο και τον διάλογο ‒το αντίθετο θα έλεγα‒, δεν μας αποξένωσε από τους άλλους, δεν τρεφόμαστε με χάπια ούτε γίναμε ρομπότ. Έχουν γίνει μεγάλες αλλαγές σε πάρα πολλούς τομείς, δεν τις έχουμε αφομοιώσει ακόμη, και γίνονται κι άλλες, μεγαλύτερες. Είμαστε μέσα σ’ αυτή την εξέλιξη και τη δίνη. Πάντα οι αλλαγές φοβίζουν, αλλά έτσι προχωράει η ανθρωπότητα. Με τους πιο συντηρητικούς να πατάνε φρένο και να θέτουν περιορισμούς και τους πιο ρηξικέλευθους να ανοίγουν ατρόμητοι νέους δρόμους. Χρειάζονται και οι δύο. Γι’ αυτό δεν μου αρέσει η ειρωνεία και η περιφρόνηση των συντηρητικών. Είναι απαραίτητοι.

— Πώς μπορεί ένας άνθρωπος να νοηματοδοτήσει τη ζωή του;

Αυτή είναι κλασική ερώτηση στους φιλοσόφους: ποιο είναι το νόημα της ζωής ή πώς να νοηματοδοτήσει κανείς τη ζωή του. Πρέπει να κάνει κανείς πολλά χρόνια φιλοσοφία, χωρίς να ασχολείται ευθέως με αυτό το ερώτημα, για να μπορέσει να το σκεφτεί με κάπως επεξεργασμένο τρόπο. Αν προσπαθήσει να το απαντήσει με συνταγές, θα ακουστεί σαν τον Κοέλιο. Η μόνη κάπως κατάλληλη απάντηση που μπορώ να σκεφτώ είναι να πούμε πως είναι σημαντικό να κατανοήσουμε την ανθρώπινη συνθήκη, δηλαδή τη θέση μας στον κόσμο, και να συμφιλιωθούμε με τα πεπερασμένα μας όρια, το αβέβαιο, σύντομο και απρόβλεπτο της ζωής.

 

— Θα θέλατε να μας κάνετε ένα σχόλιο σχετικά με τις αποκαλύψεις του ΜeΤoo στην Ελλάδα; Είναι ένα θέμα, περιστατικά του οποίου υπάρχουν και στα πανεπιστημιακά ιδρύματα. Η ισότητα είναι μόνο στη θεωρία πιστεύετε; 

Έχουμε κάνει προόδους ως προς την ισότητα, τόσο στη θεωρία όσο και στην πράξη, και στην Ελλάδα. Αλλά οι γυναίκες ‒και όχι μόνο‒, που είναι το μισό του πληθυσμού, υφίστανται για αιώνες ‒και σήμερα‒ διακρίσεις και κακοποιητική ή παρενοχλητική συμπεριφορά, η οποία σκεπάζεται από βαριά σιωπή. Ακόμη και τώρα υπάρχει βαριά σιωπή. Υπάρχει φόβος γιατί υπάρχει δυσπιστία και απειλή και τα θέματα κουκουλώνονται. Οπότε είναι καλό και απελευθερωτικό να αναδειχτεί το φαινόμενο.

 

Στα πανεπιστήμια θυμάμαι να έχουν καταγγελθεί τέτοιες υποθέσεις στο παρελθόν και στο εξωτερικό, όπου το θέμα έχει μελετηθεί ειδικά, έχει διαπιστωθεί η έκταση του φαινομένου. Αυτό που προσπαθούμε τώρα να κάνουμε ως επιτροπές ισότητας φύλου στα πανεπιστήμια είναι να θεσπίσουμε εκείνες τις διαδικασίες που θα επιτρέπουν σε όλα τα μέλη της ακαδημαϊκής κοινότητας να εκφράζουν τα προβλήματα και τις ανησυχίες τους, συμπεριλαμβανομένων αυτών που αφορούν τη σεξουαλική παρενόχληση. Να έχουν εμπιστοσύνη, να βρίσκουν υποστήριξη και φροντίδα. Επιπλέον, θα εισηγηθούμε μέτρα πρόληψης, ελέγχου καταγγελιών και πειθαρχικές κυρώσεις για όσους αποδειχτούν ένοχοι τέτοιων συμπεριφορών.

 

— Τι έχετε μάθει από την προσωπική σας ενασχόληση με τη Φιλοσοφία; 

Έχω μάθει να σκέφτομαι συγκροτημένα, με λογική αυστηρότητα. Σ’ αυτό με έχουν βοηθήσει και οι Φυσικές Επιστήμες και τα Μαθηματικά (το πρώτο μου πτυχίο είναι στη Χημεία). Φιλοσοφία δεν είναι ωραία λόγια, συχνά επιτηδευμένα ασαφή και βαθυστόχαστα, ούτε ελεύθερος συνειρμός.

 

Ασφαλώς δεν καταφέρνω πάντα να σκέφτομαι αυστηρά, αλλά είναι ένα ιδεώδες που το προβάλλει και το καλλιεργεί το είδος της φιλοσοφίας που κάνω και μελετώ. Έχω μάθει να αποφεύγω τις απλοποιήσεις, να επερωτώ τα αυτονόητα, να κάνω διακρίσεις, να αντιμετωπίζω κατά το δυνατόν μεθοδικά και ψύχραιμα τις δυσκολίες, να ελέγχω επιχειρήματα και ισχυρισμούς. Και βέβαια, έχω απολαύσει τα υψηλά κείμενα μεγάλων φιλοσόφων που διανοίγουν νέους δρόμους στη σκέψη, διευρύνοντας αλλά και χαράσσοντας όρια. 

 

— Ποιος είναι ο μεγαλύτερός σας φόβος; 

Όχι ο θάνατος, αλλά η θανατική ποινή. Η διακοπή της ζωής σου να είναι στα χέρια άλλων, όποιοι κι αν είναι αυτοί. Φρικτό. Γι’ αυτό, μεταξύ άλλων, είμαι τόσο κατηγορηματικά αντίθετη στη θανατική ποινή. Θυμάμαι ακόμη πολύ έντονα τους πέντε τελευταίους εκτελεσθέντες του φρανκικού καθεστώτος το 1975, την εκτέλεση του Αλί Μπούτο, Προέδρου του Πακιστάν το 1979, και την εκτέλεση του Σαντάμ Χουσεΐν το 2006. Για να μη μιλήσουμε για τις αποτρόπαιες πράξεις του ISIS.

 

— Τι θεωρείτε σημαντικό στη ζωή; 

Να ζεις με αξιοπρέπεια.

Musik, die dich dumm macht.

Die klügsten Menschen bevorzugen die großartigste Musik:
Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms, etc. Das entgegengesetzte Extrem sind Rap und R&B.

Der Unterschied liegt in der intellektuellen und emotionalen Raffinesse der Musik; wenn Rap eine Addition ist, ist der späte Beethoven höhere Differentialgeometrie -- und Bach ist vielleicht Stringtheorie oder so etwas in der Richtung.

Als Beispiel wollen wir uns Bachs "Krabbenkanon" ansehen.

Alphabet of Ugarit

datation 14th century BC

provenance Ugarit

area Syria

period 2000-1000 BC

size 1.3 cm x 5.1 cm

materials Clay .

themes Commerce. Communication. Daily Life.

This clay tablet was discovered at the site of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra) located along the Syrian coast, 10 km north of Latakia. Ugarit was the capital city of the Empire bearing the same name.

The Ugarit excavations present important collections of cuneiform tablets. These tablets reveal the usage of cuneiform script to write various different languages including Sumerian, Acadian- Babylonian, Hurrian, Cypriote, Aegean and Hittite. Also discovered were Egyptian Hieroglyphic scripts. This wide diversity of languages indicates the richness and notability of Ugarit among the nations of the old world, particularly in terms of communication, commercial interaction and cultural openness. It is evident that the scribes of Ugarit knew of the various people’s scripts and languages and used them in their commercial correspondences.

Yet, the greatest role of this city is the thinking of its people and the development of the first ever phonetically based script. To transcend the accumulation of various languages and the confusion this caused, the people of Ugarit developed their own writing system. They changed the cuneiform script to represent the sounds of their spoken tongue. While previously writing was only for a special class of rulers or priests, the people of Ugarit put into writing their own everyday language, and made the capacity for writing and the preservation of knowledge more widely available.

They abbreviated hundreds of cuneiform syllables into the 29 letters representing sounds used in the spoken language of the people of Ugarit. Thus the first alphabet was created and the history of writing was transformed.

The alphabet of Ugarit was found transcribed on some small tablets in the royal palace of the city which was discovered in 1948. This tablet is read from left to right and its letters are ordered phonetically in a manner which we later find in the Canaanite, Aramaic and Arabic written letters. Speaking to the French Academy in 17 February 1950, the scientist Charles Virolleaud said: "There is no doubt that we will not know the name of the alphabet creator, but we know that he is Phoenician or in general Syrian, and we can say that the people, who achieved this miracle, deserve our gratitude, and it has the right to have a special dignity in the history of the world."

The thread - on the way to dissolution - has been fascinating and I've not much to add except that the list of topics avoids almost every major achievement of the humanities (and therefore the reasons why governments, pressure groups etc like to attack them).

Feminism arose in the 1970s not from STEM but from HASS (humanities arts and social science). STEM did not propel postcolonial and decolonial studies or critical race studies - if anything they lent their support to the lie of biological racism. I always presumed that STS science and tech studies changed its name from History and Philosophy of Science to broaden its field but also to escape its subservient role in med schools ectetera. But like critical digital studies it owes little to schools of computing (this comment might be out of order but it has in general been at the margins where computing meets HASS that the key work has been done). Critical disability studies didn't emerge from engineering schools tho it should have. HASS have changed the intellectual and ethical landscape of the 21st century at least as profoundly as STEM

On the positive side, the scientists have been far better at communicating the arcana of quantum theory and DNA than in general we have been in communicating what HASS does to the general public (tip of the hat to Nick Mirzoeff for his efforts). Feminists and critical race scholars - Ta Nahisi Coates  - have done huge things here; Rebecca Solnit out of environmental humanities - but no big statements for several decades of what we collectively are doing and why.

That is exactly what a major initiative should be doing. Broad is more important than deep

I have a few thoughts: the first has to do with these one-off comments
about "deep," the second has to do with the gender aspect of this thread
in just five messages long. They're related, in a way.

(1) DEEP

Somewhere in my piles of scribbles I have some notes for an essay on the
poetics of "deep." tl;dr: no, *do* forget web, pockets, and Europe.
Those associations are fine, but there are better ways to approach this
kind of thing than a couple of guys dashing off whatever comes to mind.

One of my favorite mini-methods for just-add-water cultural analysis is
Google's autocomplete ? say, what it coughs up if you type in "deep
a", "deep b", "deep c", etc. 26 searches is boring, but its rote,
mechanical quality forces you to look at what other people are thinking.
In this case it's pretty funny (part of me wants to say *deeply
ironic*), because you're staring the problem right in its face: what do
millions, maybe billions of people mean when they think "deep"?

There are several ~layers of meaning, but I'll just get to a few:

One is older, and has a miscellaneous quality because "deep" is literal:
"deep pockets," "deep ocean," "deep end," etc. They're not so
interesting, though "deep sleep" is one of them, and it was probably a
basis for later, more metaphorical notions of deep."

Then there's another layer where the marketing kick in, and you start to
see more metaphorical phrases like "deep conditioner" or "deep tissue
massage." This second layer is less miscellaneous because the marketing
has a focus, the human body. In this sense, "deep" takes on a new,
latent meaning through an implied contrast ? not just with a
traditional antonym like "shallow", I think, but with something more
like "superficial." It's not so explicit in this context, but this turn
came with gendering ? I think because commercial representations of
bodies tended to focus on women first, and conveyed a sort of
double-bind message: your body is a chronic problem / this product will
fix or maintain it /  turn your body into a promise. Lather, rinse,
repeat, as they say.

I'll fast-forward past a bunch of other mutations in the micro-poetics
of depth, rooted in things like the rise of certain styles of
audio-production (especially in "industrial" music), "deep ecology"
(first used in 1973 but only widely adopted in English in the '90s), the
rise of aerial and satellite surveillance (which promoted a vertical
perspective that made high-resolution a matter of "depth," and not just
in the optical sense of depth of field ? see William Burrows's seminal
book on space-based intelligence, _Deep Black: Space Espionage and
National Security). But those things would all need essays in their own
right, some of which have been written.

One sign the poetics of depth was catching on was the glut of movies and
TV in the '90s: Star Trek ? Deep Space Nine, Deep Cover, Deep Impact,
Deep Blue Sea, Deep Rising, The Deep, etc, etc.

For me, the key shift was the use of "deep" to describe statecraft or
the appearance of it. The obvious reference is the "deep state," which
was first used in Turkey in the '90s, and a decade or so later started
to become a staple of US political vocabulary ? probably an
interesting history of how that happened, but one that'll likely never
be written. But part of the reason it worked is that "deep" had been a
staple in paranoiac rightist ideas about "deep cover," "sleeper cells,"
and "Manchurian" this and that ? some of which vaguely referred not
just to anti-Soviet ideas but also to anti-Chinese kookiness about
"brainwashing," dating from the Korean War. That background might
explain why the name of a '72 porn movie was adopted as the pseudonym
for the Watergate informer "Deep Throat" in the same year.

There were other, more progressive uses, like Pauline Oliveros's phrase
"deep listening," which was both a pun. IIRC see coined it around '90 or
so after a recording experiment in some subterranean chamber ? but it
also referred to a more deliberate but also open focus, which is related
to emerging ideas about "immersive" experiences ? another implicit
reference to depth, but one that also tacitly invokes intensifying
modernist ideas about rising distraction (cf. the 2016 self-help book
Deep Work about avoiding distraction). I think Oliveros probably was
tapping into the kinds of thinking that characterized ideas like "deep
ecology," with their emphasis on forms of connection and engagement that
eluded conventional and technocratic ways of slicing and dicing the
world.

Also: Deep Thoughts is the name of the computer in Hitchhiker's Guide to
the Galaxy, which probably accounts for a huge swath of "deep" names in
tech, even if the bros don't know it (let alone know it was a joke).

So those are the main clusters of cultural noise that were available or
in the air when tech bro culture started to tag things as "deep": deep
web (not to be confused with the dark web), Deep Blue (the chess-playing
computational system), deep neural networks (DNNs), deep linguistic
processing (DLP), deep dream (AI-based image generation), deepfakes,
Deepmind (an AI company), Deep Nostalgia (dumb app that animates old
photo portraits). These things are pretty different, in that they tap
into different parts of these histories; but they're all pretty the same
because they're all "deep," right?

Once the bros got involved, it became obligatory to call everything
"deep." For example, "deep learning" was a stated goal of ML/AI
researchers ? it doesn't have anything to do with what we'd
traditionally associate with deep knowledge, it's just the kind of low
bar with a high name that tech culture loves (like "artificial
intelligence"). So you can tack "deep" on to pretty much anything, and a
huge swath of people will take it seriously. If I started talking about
"deep papier mache," an alarming number of people would assume I meant
some serious, more fundamental understanding of the it as a history,
medium, practice, whatever, but it's just a phrase I made up.

(2) GENDER, SORT OF

When I saw Anya's encouraging remark, in contrast to the more negative
one-liners, I was like ?, especially because it felt like I'm part of
the kind of pile-on that's made Nettime such a problematic space.

Unfortunately, like I said, the initiative looks like it capitulates to
that kind of culture rather than challenging.

It might make real sense at SJSU as an internal strategy for promoting
certain forms of knowledge and study, but when a document like that
escapes that orbit it becomes ridiculous. It can be both things at once.

Cheers,
Ted

We could track contemporary versions of the so called ?depth narrative?
back to structuralists such as Levi Strause arguing that beneath the
surface of the social world is a structure or a grammar. As well as
seeing the antecedence of Marx and Freud who don?t believe that whats
happening on the surface tell you as much as knowing what is going on
below in the depths. Geology is the model here for way of knowing about
how shape of the landscape came to be the way it is by digging below the
surface.

This depth narrative has never been without its critics later
structuralists and post-structuralists inverted the story by celebrating
the surface at the expense of depth. Particularly Barthes who was
famously uncomfortable with ?meaning?, which he described as heavy,
sticky declaring that ?I?ve always wanted to be exempt from meaning the
way one is exempt from military service?. ? As a realist he recognised
that he couldn't escape it altogether but applies for some kind of
temporary exemption, a rest from meaning.? From a visual arts standpoint
I have always seen this tussle as echoing the arrival of Warhol on the
scene whose slippery serious anti-seriousness effectively disrupted
Abstract Expressionism?s existentialist claims to psychological depth.

It’s hard to convey the full depth and range of the trauma, the chaos and the
indignity that people are being subjected to. Meanwhile, Modi and his allies are
telling us not to complain

by Arundhati Roy

The Guardian, Wed 28 Apr 2021.

During a particularly polarising election campaign in the state of Uttar Pradesh
in 2017, India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, waded into the fray to stir things
up even further. From a public podium, he accused the state government – which was
led by an opposition party – of pandering to the Muslim community by spending more
on Muslim graveyards (kabristans) than on Hindu cremation grounds (shamshans).
With his customary braying sneer, in which every taunt and barb rises to a high
note mid-sentence before it falls away in a menacing echo, he stirred up the
crowd. “If a kabristan is built in a village, a shamshan should also be
constructed there,” he said.

“Shamshan! Shamshan!” the mesmerised, adoring crowd echoed back.

Perhaps he is happy now that the haunting image of the flames rising from the mass
funerals in India’s cremation grounds is making the front page of international
newspapers. And that all the kabristans and shamshans in his country are working
properly, in direct proportion to the populations they cater for, and far beyond
their capacities.


“Can India, population 1.3 billion, be isolated?” the Washington Post asked
rhetorically in a recent editorial about India’s unfolding catastrophe and the
difficulty of containing new, fast-spreading Covid variants within national
borders. “Not easily,” it replied. It’s unlikely this question was posed in quite
the same way when the coronavirus was raging through the UK and Europe just a few
months ago. But we in India have little right to take offence, given our prime
minister’s words at the World Economic Forum in January this year.

Modi spoke at a time when people in Europe and the US were suffering through the
peak of the second wave of the pandemic. He had not one word of sympathy to offer,
only a long, gloating boast about India’s infrastructure and Covid-preparedness. I
downloaded the speech because I fear that when history is rewritten by the Modi
regime, as it soon will be, it might disappear, or become hard to find. Here are
some priceless snippets:

“Friends, I have brought the message of confidence, positivity and hope from 1.3
billion Indians amid these times of apprehension … It was predicted that India
would be the most affected country from corona all over the world. It was said
that there would be a tsunami of corona infections in India, somebody said 700-800
million Indians would get infected while others said 2 million Indians would die.”

“Friends, it would not be advisable to judge India’s success with that of another
country. In a country which is home to 18% of the world population, that country
has saved humanity from a big disaster by containing corona effectively.”

Modi the magician takes a bow for saving humanity by containing the coronavirus
effectively. Now that it turns out that he has not contained it, can we complain
about being viewed as though we are radioactive? That other countries’ borders are
being closed to us and flights are being cancelled? That we’re being sealed in
with our virus and our prime minister, along with all the sickness, the
anti-science, the hatred and the idiocy that he, his party and its brand of
politics represent?


When the first wave of Covid came to India and then subsided last year, the
government and its supportive commentariat were triumphant. “India isn’t having a
picnic,” tweeted Shekhar Gupta, the editor-in-chief of the online news site the
Print. “But our drains aren’t choked with bodies, hospitals aren’t out of beds,
nor crematoriums & graveyards out of wood or space. Too good to be true? Bring
data if you disagree. Unless you think you’re god.” Leave aside the callous,
disrespectful imagery – did we need a god to tell us that most pandemics have a
second wave?

This one was predicted, although its virulence has taken even scientists and
virologists by surprise. So where is the Covid-specific infrastructure and the
“people’s movement” against the virus that Modi boasted about in his speech?
Hospital beds are unavailable. Doctors and medical staff are at breaking point.
Friends call with stories about wards with no staff and more dead patients than
live ones. People are dying in hospital corridors, on roads and in their homes.
Crematoriums in Delhi have run out of firewood. The forest department has had to
give special permission for the felling of city trees. Desperate people are using
whatever kindling they can find. Parks and car parks are being turned into
cremation grounds. It’s as if there’s an invisible UFO parked in our skies,
sucking the air out of our lungs. An air raid of a kind we’ve never known.


Oxygen is the new currency on India’s morbid new stock exchange. Senior
politicians, journalists, lawyers – India’s elite – are on Twitter pleading for
hospital beds and oxygen cylinders. The hidden market for cylinders is booming.
Oxygen saturation machines and drugs are hard to come by.

There are markets for other things, too. At the bottom end of the free market, a
bribe to sneak a last look at your loved one, bagged and stacked in a hospital
mortuary. A surcharge for a priest who agrees to say the final prayers. Online
medical consultancies in which desperate families are fleeced by ruthless doctors.
At the top end, you might need to sell your land and home and use up every last
rupee for treatment at a private hospital. Just the deposit alone, before they
even agree to admit you, could set your family back a couple of generations.

None of this conveys the full depth and range of the trauma, the chaos and, above
all, the indignity that people are being subjected to. What happened to my young
friend T is just one of hundreds, perhaps thousands of similar stories in Delhi
alone. T, who is in his 20s, lives in his parents’ tiny flat in Ghaziabad on the
outskirts of Delhi. All three of them tested positive for Covid. His mother was
critically ill. Since it was in the early days, he was lucky enough to find a
hospital bed for her. His father, diagnosed with severe bipolar depression, turned
violent and began to harm himself. He stopped sleeping. He soiled himself. His
psychiatrist was online trying to help, although she also broke down from time to
time because her husband had just died from Covid. She said T’s father needed
hospitalisation, but since he was Covid positive there was no chance of that. So T
stayed awake, night after night, holding his father down, sponging him, cleaning
him up. Each time I spoke to him I felt my own breath falter. Finally, the message
came: “Father’s dead.” He did not die of Covid, but of a massive spike in blood
pressure induced by a psychiatric meltdown induced by utter helplessness.

What to do with the body? I desperately called everybody I knew. Among those who
responded was Anirban Bhattacharya, who works with the well-known social activist
Harsh Mander. Bhattacharya is about to stand trial on a charge of sedition for a
protest he helped organise on his university campus in 2016. Mander, who has not
fully recovered from a savage case of Covid last year, is being threatened with
arrest and the closure of the orphanages he runs after he mobilised people against
the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)
passed in December 2020, both of which blatantly discriminate against Muslims.

Mander and Bhattacharya are among the many citizens who, in the absence of all
forms of governance, have set up helplines and emergency responses, and are
running themselves ragged organising ambulances and coordinating funerals and the
transport of dead bodies. It’s not safe for these volunteers to do what they’re
doing. In this wave of the pandemic, it’s the young who are falling, who are
filling the intensive care units. When young people die, the older among us lose a
little of our will to live.

T’s father was cremated. T and his mother are recovering.


Things will settle down eventually. Of course, they will. But we don’t know who
among us will survive to see that day. The rich will breathe easier. The poor will
not. For now, among the sick and dying, there is a vestige of democracy. The rich
have been felled, too. Hospitals are begging for oxygen. Some have started
bring-your-own-oxygen schemes. The oxygen crisis has led to intense, unseemly
battles between states, with political parties trying to deflect blame from
themselves.


On the night of 22 April, 25 critically ill coronavirus patients on high-flow
oxygen died in one of Delhi’s biggest private hospitals, Sir Ganga Ram. The
hospital issued several desperate SOS messages for the replenishment of its oxygen
supply. A day later, the chair of the hospital board rushed to clarify matters:
“We cannot say that they have died due to lack of oxygen support.” On 24 April, 20
more patients died when oxygen supplies were depleted in another big Delhi
hospital, Jaipur Golden. That same day, in the Delhi high court, Tushar Mehta,
India’s solicitor general, speaking for the government of India, said: “Let’s try
and not be a cry baby … so far we have ensured that no one in the country was left
without oxygen.”

Ajay Mohan Bisht, the saffron-robed chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, who goes by
the name Yogi Adityanath, has declared that there is no shortage of oxygen in any
hospital in his state and that rumourmongers will be arrested without bail under
the National Security Act and have their property seized.

Yogi Adityanath doesn’t play around. Siddique Kappan, a Muslim journalist from
Kerala, jailed for months in Uttar Pradesh when he and two others travelled there
to report on the gang-rape and murder of a Dalit girl in Hathras district, is
critically ill and has tested positive for Covid. His wife, in a desperate
petition to the chief justice of the supreme court of India, says her husband is
lying chained “like an animal” to a hospital bed in the Medical College hospital
in Mathura. (The supreme court has now ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to
move him to a hospital in Delhi.) So, if you live in Uttar Pradesh, the message
seems to be, please do yourself a favour and die without complaining. ￼ The threat
to those who complain is not restricted to Uttar Pradesh. A spokesperson for the
fascist Hindu nationalist organisation the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) – of
which Modi and several of his ministers are members, and which runs its own armed
militia – has warned that “anti-India forces” would use the crisis to fuel
“negativity” and “mistrust” and asked the media to help foster a “positive
atmosphere”. Twitter has helped them out by deactivating accounts critical of the
government.

Where shall we look for solace? For science? Shall we cling to numbers? How many
dead? How many recovered? How many infected? When will the peak come? On 27 April,
the report was 323,144 new cases, 2,771 deaths. The precision is somewhat
reassuring. Except – how do we know? Tests are hard to come by, even in Delhi. The
number of Covid-protocol funerals from graveyards and crematoriums in small towns
and cities suggest a death toll up to 30 times higher than the official count.
Doctors who are working outside the metropolitan areas can tell you how it is.


If Delhi is breaking down, what should we imagine is happening in villages in
Bihar, in Uttar Pradesh, in Madhya Pradesh? Where tens of millions of workers from
the cities, carrying the virus with them, are fleeing home to their families,
traumatised by their memory of Modi’s national lockdown in 2020. It was the
strictest lockdown in the world, announced with only four hours’ notice. It left
migrant workers stranded in cities with no work, no money to pay their rent, no
food and no transport. Many had to walk hundreds of miles to their homes in
far-flung villages. Hundreds died on the way.

This time around, although there is no national lockdown, the workers have left
while transport is still available, while trains and buses are still running.
They’ve left because they know that even though they make up the engine of the
economy in this huge country, when a crisis comes, in the eyes of this
administration, they simply don’t exist. This year’s exodus has resulted in a
different kind of chaos: there are no quarantine centres for them to stay in
before they enter their village homes. There’s not even the meagre pretence of
trying to protect the countryside from the city virus.

These are villages where people die of easily treatable diseases like diarrhoea
and tuberculosis. How are they to cope with Covid? Are Covid tests available to
them? Are there hospitals? Is there oxygen? More than that, is there love? Forget
love, is there even concern? There isn’t. Because there is only a heart-shaped
hole filled with cold indifference where India’s public heart should be.


Early this morning, on 28 April, news came that our friend Prabhubhai has died.
Before he died, he showed classic Covid symptoms. But his death will not register
in the official Covid count because he died at home without a test or treatment.
Prabhubhai was a stalwart of the anti-dam movement in the Narmada valley. I stayed
several times at his home in Kevadia, where decades ago the first group of
indigenous tribespeople were thrown off their lands to make room for the
dam-builders and officers’ colony. Displaced families like Prabhubhai’s still
remain on the edges of that colony, impoverished and unsettled, transgressors on
land that was once theirs.

There is no hospital in Kevadia. There’s only the Statue of Unity, built in the
likeness of the freedom fighter and first deputy prime minister of India, Sardar
Vallabhbhai Patel, who the dam is named after. At 182 metres high, it’s the
tallest statue in the world and cost US$422m. High-speed elevators inside take
tourists up to view the Narmada dam from the level of Sardar Patel’s chest. Of
course, you cannot see the river valley civilisation that lies destroyed,
submerged in the depths of the vast reservoir, or hear the stories of the people
who waged one of the most beautiful, profound struggles the world has ever known –
not just against that one dam, but against the accepted ideas of what constitutes
civilisation, happiness and progress. The statue was Modi’s pet project. He
inaugurated it in October 2018. ￼

The friend who messaged about Prabhubhai had spent years as an anti-dam activist
in the Narmada valley. She wrote: “My hands shiver as I write this. Covid
situation in and around Kevadia Colony grim.”


The precise numbers that make up India’s Covid graph are like the wall that was
built in Ahmedabad to hide the slums Donald Trump would drive past on his way to
the “Namaste Trump” event that Modi hosted for him in February 2020. Grim as those
numbers are, they give you a picture of the India-that-matters, but certainly not
the India that is. In the India that is, people are expected to vote as Hindus,
but die as disposables.

“Let’s try and not be a cry baby.”

Try not to pay attention to the fact that the possibility of a dire shortage of
oxygen had been flagged as far back as April 2020, and then again in November by a
committee set up by the government itself. Try not to wonder why even Delhi’s
biggest hospitals don’t have their own oxygen-generating plants. Try not to wonder
why the PM Cares Fund – the opaque organisation that has recently replaced the
more public Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund, and which uses public money and
government infrastructure but functions like a private trust with zero public
accountability – has suddenly moved in to address the oxygen crisis. Will Modi own
shares in our air-supply now?

“Let’s try and not be a cry baby.”


Understand that there were and are so many far more pressing issues for the Modi
government to attend to. Destroying the last vestiges of democracy, persecuting
non-Hindu minorities and consolidating the foundations of the Hindu Nation makes
for a relentless schedule. There are massive prison complexes, for example, that
must be urgently constructed in Assam for the 2 million people who have lived
there for generations and have suddenly been stripped of their citizenship. (On
this matter, our independent supreme court came down hard on the side of the
government and leniently on the side of the vandals.)

There are hundreds of students and activists and young Muslim citizens to be tried
and imprisoned as the primary accused in the anti-Muslim pogrom that took place
against their own community in north-east Delhi last March. If you are Muslim in
India, it’s a crime to be murdered. Your folks will pay for it. There was the
inauguration of the new Ram Temple in Ayodhya, which is being built in place of
the mosque that was hammered to dust by Hindu vandals watched over by senior BJP
politicians. (On this matter, our independent supreme court came down hard on the
side of the government and the vandals.) There were the controversial new Farm
Bills to be passed, corporatising agriculture. There were hundreds of thousands of
farmers to be beaten and teargassed when they came out on to the streets to
protest.

Then there’s the multi-multi-multimillion-dollar plan for a grand new replacement
for the fading grandeur of New Delhi’s imperial centre to be urgently attended to.
After all, how can the government of the new Hindu India be housed in old
buildings? While Delhi is locked down, ravaged by the pandemic, construction work
on the “Central Vista” project, declared as an essential service, has begun.
Workers are being transported in. Maybe they can alter the plans to add a
crematorium. ￼

There was also the Kumbh Mela to be organised, so that millions of Hindu pilgrims
could crowd together in a small town to bathe in the Ganges and spread the virus
even-handedly as they returned to their homes across the country, blessed and
purified. This Kumbh rocks on, although Modi has gently suggested that it might be
an idea for the holy dip to become “symbolic” – whatever that means. (Unlike what
happened with those who attended a conference for the Islamic organisation
Tablighi Jamaat last year, the media has not run a campaign against them calling
them “corona jihadis” or accusing them of committing crimes against humanity.)
There were also those few thousand Rohingya refugees who had to be urgently
deported back to the genocidal regime in Myanmar from where they had fled – in the
middle of a coup. (Once again, when our independent supreme court was petitioned
on this matter, it concurred with the government’s view.)

So, as you can tell, it’s been busy, busy, busy.


Over and above all this urgent activity, there is an election to be won in the
state of West Bengal. This required our home minister, Modi’s man Amit Shah, to
more or less abandon his cabinet duties and focus all his attention on Bengal for
months, to disseminate his party’s murderous propaganda, to pit human against
human in every little town and village. Geographically, West Bengal is a small
state. The election could have taken place in a single day, and has done so in the
past. But since it is new territory for the BJP, the party needed time to move its
cadres, many of who are not from Bengal, from constituency to constituency to
oversee the voting. The election schedule was divided into eight phases, spread
out over a month, the last on 29 April. As the count of corona infections ticked
up, the other political parties pleaded with the election commission to rethink
the election schedule. The commission refused and came down hard on the side of
the BJP, and the campaign continued. Who hasn’t seen the videos of the BJP’s star
campaigner, the prime minister himself, triumphant and maskless, speaking to the
maskless crowds, thanking people for coming out in unprecedented numbers? That was
on 17 April, when the official number of daily infections was already rocketing
upward of 200,000.

Now, as voting closes, Bengal is poised to become the new corona cauldron, with a
new triple mutant strain known as – guess what – the “Bengal strain”. Newspapers
report that every second person tested in the state capital, Kolkata, is Covid
positive. The BJP has declared that if it wins Bengal, it will ensure people get
free vaccines. And if it doesn’t?

“Let’s try and not be a cry baby.”

Anyway, what about the vaccines? Surely they’ll save us? Isn’t India a vaccine
powerhouse? In fact, the Indian government is entirely dependent on two
manufacturers, the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech. Both are
being allowed to roll out two of the most expensive vaccines in the world, to the
poorest people in the world. This week they announced that they will sell to
private hospitals at a slightly elevated price, and to state governments at a
somewhat lower price. Back-of-the-envelope calculations show the vaccine companies
are likely to make obscene profits.

Under Modi, India’s economy has been hollowed out, and hundreds of millions of
people who were already living precarious lives have been pushed into abject
poverty. A huge number now depend for survival on paltry earnings from the
National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), which was instituted in 2005 when
the Congress party was in power. It is impossible to expect that families on the
verge of starvation will pay most of a month’s income to have themselves
vaccinated. In the UK, vaccines are free and a fundamental right. Those trying to
get vaccinated out of turn can be prosecuted. In India, the main underlying
impetus of the vaccination campaign seems to be corporate profit. ￼

As this epic catastrophe plays out on our Modi-aligned Indian television channels,
you’ll notice how they all speak in one tutored voice. The “system” has collapsed,
they say, again and again. The virus has overwhelmed India’s health care “system”.


The system has not collapsed. The “system” barely existed. The government – this
one, as well as the Congress government that preceded it – deliberately dismantled
what little medical infrastructure there was. This is what happens when a pandemic
hits a country with an almost nonexistent public healthcare system. India spends
about 1.25% of its gross domestic product on health, far lower than most countries
in the world, even the poorest ones. Even that figure is thought to be inflated,
because things that are important but do not strictly qualify as healthcare have
been slipped into it. So the real figure is estimated to be more like 0.34%. The
tragedy is that in this devastatingly poor country, as a 2016 Lancet study shows,
78% of the healthcare in urban areas and 71% in rural areas is now handled by the
private sector. The resources that remain in the public sector are systematically
siphoned into the private sector by a nexus of corrupt administrators and medical
practitioners, corrupt referrals and insurance rackets.

Healthcare is a fundamental right. The private sector will not cater to starving,
sick, dying people who don’t have money. This massive privatisation of India’s
healthcare is a crime.


The system hasn’t collapsed. The government has failed. Perhaps “failed” is an
inaccurate word, because what we are witnessing is not criminal negligence, but an
outright crime against humanity. Virologists predict that the number of cases in
India will grow exponentially to more than 500,000 a day. They predict the death
of many hundreds of thousands in the coming months, perhaps more. My friends and I
have agreed to call each other every day just to mark ourselves present, like roll
call in our school classrooms. We speak to those we love in tears, and with
trepidation, not knowing if we will ever see each other again. We write, we work,
not knowing if we will live to finish what we started. Not knowing what horror and
humiliation awaits us. The indignity of it all. That is what breaks us.


The hashtag #ModiMustResign is trending on social media. Some of the memes and
illustrations show Modi with a heap of skulls peeping out from behind the curtain
of his beard. Modi the Messiah speaking at a public rally of corpses. Modi and
Amit Shah as vultures, scanning the horizon for corpses to harvest votes from. But
that is only one part of the story. The other part is that the man with no
feelings, the man with empty eyes and a mirthless smile, can, like so many tyrants
in the past, arouse passionate feelings in others. His pathology is infectious.
And that is what sets him apart. In north India, which is home to his largest
voting base, and which, by dint of sheer numbers, tends to decide the political
fate of the country, the pain he inflicts seems to turn into a peculiar pleasure.

Fredrick Douglass said it right: “The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the
endurance of those whom they oppress.” How we in India pride ourselves on our
capacity to endure. How beautifully we have trained ourselves to meditate, to turn
inward, to exorcise our fury as well as justify our inability to be egalitarian.
How meekly we embrace our humiliation.

When he made his political debut as Gujarat’s new chief minister in 2001, Modi
ensured his place in posterity after what has come to be known as the 2002 Gujarat
pogrom. Over a period of a few days, Hindu vigilante mobs, watched over and
sometimes actively assisted by the Gujarat police, murdered, raped and burned
alive thousands of Muslims as “revenge” for a gruesome arson attack on a train in
which more than 50 Hindu pilgrims had been burned alive. Once the violence
subsided, Modi, who had until then only been appointed as chief minister by his
party, called for early elections. The campaign in which he was portrayed as Hindu
Hriday Samrat (“The Emperor of Hindu Hearts”) won him a landslide victory. Modi
hasn’t lost an election since.

Several of the killers in the Gujrat pogrom were subsequently captured on camera
by the journalist Ashish Khetan, boasting of how they hacked people to death,
slashed pregnant women’s stomachs open and smashed infants’ heads against rocks.
They said they could only have done what they did because Modi was their chief
minister. Those tapes were broadcast on national TV. While Modi remained in the
seat of power, Khetan, whose tapes were submitted to the courts and forensically
examined, appeared as a witness on several occasions. Over time, some of the
killers were arrested and imprisoned, but many were let off. In his recent book,
Undercover: My Journey Into the Darkness of Hindutva, Khetan describes in detail
how, during Modi’s tenure as chief minister, the Gujarat police, judges, lawyers,
prosecutors and inquiry committees all colluded to tamper with evidence,
intimidate witnesses and transfer judges.

Despite knowing all this, many of India’s so-called public intellectuals, the CEOs
of its major corporations and the media houses they own, worked hard to pave the
way for Modi to become the prime minister. They humiliated and shouted down those
of us who persisted in our criticism. “Move on”, was their mantra. Even today,
they mitigate their harsh words for Modi with praise for his oratory skills and
his “hard work”. Their denunciation and bullying contempt for politicians in
opposition parties is far more strident. They reserve their special scorn for
Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party, the only politician who has consistently
warned of the coming Covid crisis and repeatedly asked the government to prepare
itself as best it could. To assist the ruling party in its campaign to destroy all
opposition parties amounts to colluding with the destruction of democracy.


So here we are now, in the hell of their collective making, with every independent
institution essential to the functioning of a democracy compromised and hollowed
out, and a virus that is out of control.


The crisis-generating machine that we call our government is incapable of leading
us out of this disaster. Not least because one man makes all the decisions in this
government, and that man is dangerous – and not very bright. This virus is an
international problem. To deal with it, decision-making, at least on the control
and administration of the pandemic, will need to pass into the hands of some sort
of non-partisan body consisting of members of the ruling party, members of the
opposition, and health and public policy experts.

As for Modi, is resigning from your crimes a feasible proposition? Perhaps he
could just take a break from them – a break from all his hard work. There’s that
$564m Boeing 777, Air India One, customised for VVIP travel – for him, actually –
that’s been sitting idle on the runway for a while now. He and his men could just
leave. The rest of us will do all we can to clean up their mess.

No, India cannot be isolated. We need help.

#+begin_quote
Amorite (Sumerian Mar.tu, Akkadian Amurrūm, Egyptian Amar, Hebrew ’emōrî) refers to a Semitic people who first occupied the country west of the Euphrates from the second half of the third millennium B.C.E.. They were originally a nomadic people whose prowess as warriors gradually brought them into a powerful position in Mesopotamia. Their rise to power brought about significant changes in Mesopotamian civilization. From 2000-1600 B.C.E., they came to dominate the region, the most famous Amorite king being the great Hammurabi.

In the later second millennium B.C.E., the Amorites migrated or were pushed westward toward Canaan. There, the Israelites treated them as enemies and left several records of their defeat by Israelite heroes such as Joshua. The Amorites disappear from the historical record as a distinct population group around the sixth century B.C.E.#+end_quote

[...]

After the exile, in the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, Jews who had intermarried with Amorites and other Canaanite women were required to divorce their wives (Ezra 9-10). It is likely that some of the Amorites came to be counted among the Samaritans, the Israelites of mixed lineage who maintained a substantial rival kingdom to the Jews during the next several centuries. The Samaritans built a temple of Yahweh on Mount Gerezim with its own priesthood, following the religious laws of Moses as expressed in the Samaratan Pentateuch. Other Amorites probably blended into the Arabic, Babylonian, and Anatolian civilizations, leaving little trace after the sixth century B.C.E..

Scripture -> Word -> Meaning -> Deed -> Process?

Object vs. Embodiment / Writing vs. Deed?

#+begin_quote
Admirers of Goethe, both James and Wittgenstein quote Faust, ‘Im Anfang war die Tat, ‘in the beginning was the deed’. James does it in ‘Bergson and his Critique of Intellectualism', one of the PU lectures, published in 1909 (but he cites Goethe on other occasions as well[1]). Wittgenstein does it in OC, among the remarks from the ‘pragmatist week’ (but he also cites Goethe on other occasions as well[2]). Clearly, this is a famous quote and they are not the only ones to have used it, but it is of interest that both were struck by the very same words, and probably for similar reasons[3]: although in different contexts, both indicate action, rather than the word, as the starting point of philosophical activity. Now the point is to understand to what extent the two aspirations share a common vision.

In the pragmatist tradition, it is James, more than Peirce, who emphasizes the theme of action; this is actually one of the acknowledged divergences between the two thinkers. Beyond working on it in connection with the pragmatic maxim, James mainly deals with action in the context of psychology.
